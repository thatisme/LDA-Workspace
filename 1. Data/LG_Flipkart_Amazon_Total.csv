Bought this AC last week and faced less cooling issue, My room size is hardly 11*11 and currently room temp howers around 30, It takes 30 min to bring down the room temp from 30 to 27,
Cooling you will feel only at places where you will get Air, called engineer twice they just test technicals and say AC is working fine

I read few reviews about less cooling from LG AC, ignored thinking it might be one odd issue and my room is anyway smaller.

Remember it Hardly...

When you get it,
First set the picture mode to vivid and reduce Sharpness to 20-23. Best ips display ever, far better than any va panel. Go for it blindly.

Cons: the only con is the web os, you won't have the freedom of Android . But it can be solved with any Chromecast device if that's your thing. Everything else is perfect about this tv .

Pros:- Easy to use after all it is automatic

Cons:-

2. Takes too much water.
3. Takes so much time even in less clothes.

I recently purchased an automatic washing machine with an 8 kg capacity, and I must say I am thoroughly disappointed with its performance. Despite the advertised capacity, the machine struggles to wash a full 8 kg load effectively. To achieve proper washing results, I find myself limiting the load to just 5-6 kg.

The spinner is incredibly slow, which extends the overall washing time unnecessarily. Additionally, the machine's functionality ...

5052,"Using Fake gas & copper pipe:
The service center (Royal Services Goa) used local copper pipes, several leftover pieces of insulation (instead of one continuous roll), and it seems they filled the AC with fake gas. AC was using full power but not cooling at all, the inside room temperature was higher than outside temperature & they were knowingly reporting wrong gas pressures to LG to cover up. I sent the pictures of the correct gas pressure to LG but the ASM took no action & service center stopped providing service and then closed the complaint. The installation technician also showed me samples of poor-quality copper pipes which he admitted were not from LG but from the local shop.

Overcharging & Arm twisting:
Service center said official company rates are for showing only. If I wanted officially published rates, the installation will not happen. That is exactly what they did. They kept me waiting for 10 days and then closed the complaint with reason ""customer does not want installation"" even though the matter was under escalation to with CEO's e-mail address.

Excess charges:
Extra Copper Pipe with insulation & vinyl tape: Official Rate 850/meter, Service center wanted: 1130 + gst
Power chord: Official Rate 60/meter, Service center wanted 180/meter
Gas refilling charge on brand new installation: Official rate: Free, its included, Service center wanted: 1500 + GST

Even after the matter was raised with the Area Service Manager (ASM), the ASM instead of upholding official rates said its not profitable for the service center & wanted me to directly negotiate unofficial rates with the service center.

AC not installed in 10 days:
Since I insisted on official installation prices, the service center stopped responding to calls or messages. The matter was escalated to the ASM but nothing changed.

Useless customer care:
The matter was escalated using the write to CEO link. This turned to be a total waste of time as you only get directed to customer care and get generic responses. They forwarded my complaint to the persons against whom the complaint was made. No one from LG customer care even called to find out whats going on & the harassment only increased. Amazon also escalated the issue at their end but the installation was not done in 10 days. Finally, I gave up and returned the AC.

This review is from someone who used to be a loyal LG customer. But now LG is not what it used to be.",1
5053,"Cooling, efficiency, everything is good but the copper pipe was missing in the amazon package. Had to pay for the pipe and then calim the refund from amazon. Amazon provides refund in the form of amazon pay balance which was waste of money.",3
5054,"Product is good but installing this thing is nightmare. Installation is done by brand itself on amazon & by third party installer on another e-commerce website. Brand installation is alway bad.
After hundreds of calls to LG, I received first technician visit after 7 days of delivery, when technician came to home, he told me he didn‚Äôt carry any proper rotary hammer drill and having only drill machine and mechanical hammer to make a hole, I refused to install as this could damage wall.
Again after hundreds of calls to LG, three days later another technician visited, this time he was very professional and had all the tools.
So yeah, I recommend this product to someone who have a lot of patience. Product seems good after one week of uses.",3

For installation they charge more than what's shown on Amazon app. Standard installation they charge 1415 and we have to pay extra for stand and the three pin plug and other accessories and for installation of the outdoor unit stand separately which was around 1200. LG sent an installation service fee bill of Rs.2596 but the service team charged me more. I wish the right expectations were set before installation about the charges, hence writing it here, it may cost around 3k for installation alone!! Not a fair price!!",3

Coming to the AC,it does work properly.There is no backlight in Remote which can be irritating at night without lights.AC is almost soundless ,cools my 140 sq feet room within 10-15 mins.",3
5059,Product Quality is good but service needs to be improved. I bought the AC along with stands(AC bracket) in Amazon but the service techinicans did not accept that to install and they asked me Rs. 300 extra for that otherwise I need to buy their products which costs Rs.1000 it seems. I bought 2 ACs and I lost around Rs. 500 and I tried to call Amazon and LG service centre but noresponsw from them. Please improve the service.,3

Not satisfied with the quality.
Doesn't cool fast and less cooling as compare to others.
I have samsung AC as well been using for 3 years, cools faster and make room SHIMLA within 10-15 mins.
LG claims that it consumes less Watts, but didn't see much difference as compare to Samsung AC.
Bought Samsung AC for less than the price of LG AC (almost 10k less )and it is older than LG AC, yet faster cooling and totally value for money and satisfied.
Don't go for LG AC.
LG AC has VIRAT mode as well. Just faster the Fan speed and does nothing.",2

Earlier I had a 10 yrs old 1.5 ton fixed speed Carrier AC, deployed in my living room/kitchen area with a size of approx 150 sq ft and it would chill the room. This LG AC is able to moderate the temperature to some extent but the air flow is barely noticeable even in HC mode, till the time I am sitting in front of it. This AC does not justify the steep cost!
Since, I have to run it in highest power setting or so called Virat mode all the time, I don't notice the difference in spends vs my old AC. Probably it is good for room size of 120 sq ft or less. Not impressed.
I think a Carrier or Blue star would be a better option.
I am now buying a fixed speed Windows AC from Carrier for my bedroom. Avoid Inverter ACs wherever you can.",2

We faced problem",3
5072,"They didn't mention clearly about the accessories such as wall bracket for the outdoor unit etc. Further the limitation of copper pipe is only three meters that is too short. In other countries they will provide 5-7meters in general.
Product and service may be good (not yet tested) but overall satisfaction is more important. We may not mind paying an extra buck for the important/essential accessories along with the product which may save us from headaches if the installation happens when elderly people or home care personnel at home.",3
5073,"Firstly I believed LG is best for its products until I experience their worst service experience .... Recently we purchased this AC for installation they sent some third party technician(outside mechanics) they didn't installed properly they didn't even gave receipt for our payment, the Ac condition was not so good for cooling it's takes minimum 20mins, later with some issue we contacted LG customer care services startingly they responded well but after ey didn't even send technician even a week after raising our issue, we're contacting customer care but later they not even responding to our calls ...please don't take this product as ur choice and coming to their service very very bad ...hope this review will helpfull to you... thankyou",1

5075,"Writing after 2 months of usage -
1. Water leakage in indoor unit after 2 months of usage. Will post service experience after getting it fixed.
2. The swing can't be set to blow air below. My bed is right below the AC, the swing can't be set to blow air right under it. At the lowest point I get the cool air for my feet.
3. Cooling is not great for it's configuration. Any mode I use it's almost the same.
4. Cost of operation is only slightly less compared to 3 star AC. Not much benefit if you use regularly. My electricity bill haven't reduced much.",1
5076,The AC was not working so we return the item and Thanks Amazon for refund without loosing any money. The Service from LG was very poor. The service guys come very late and took long time to fix the unit even they don't fix all screws both inside and outside units. when they open the packs they notices the damages even though don't inform us until we found the problem. Once they fixed the AC was not working even they said it will work after some time and left. Usually we are using LG previously and it is very good and i don't know why its happens now...?,3
5077,"With in a year I launched the 4 complaints on cooling and water leakaeg issues. Sensors are very delicate and sound system also has gone (Only options is replace PCB ). In warranty support is worst. Even if you launch complaint, they just do temporary fix.
After warranty, I mean after 1 year 4 months, indoor unit coil has leakage. If I want to repair these issues, I need to invest Rs. 20,000/- (Coil, Gas charges, PCB board and service changes.). My strong Recommendation is don't buy this product. And also Seller is also not trustable.",1
5078,"Even LG techinicians visited and unable to findout the chilling issue, instead online better to by in TATA Croma",2

Now they are telling it may be the compressor problem and i am waiting for last two days.Complaint open since last week and waiting for the next course of action from service center.I am so worried about this, with in few months problem started...I will update further details after this..",3

5082,"The product is ok or not I can't say but the seevice in Bangalore is so pathetic that you will regret every other day. They will give numbers which will be switched off or not answerable for eternity. After installation the product will also sometimes not work properly and you will chase them like
forever. The worst decision of my life is to spent 50k on buying LG AC",2
5083,Cupper wire was not found. I bought it locally after additional payment. As per the package inside description it has been written that 3 mts cupper wire will provided. But i did not get it. Which disappoints us.,2
5084,"Purchased latest LG Ac but not satisfied with noise level of the product
Cooling is good but the outdoor unit humming sound is very high, it is very uncomfortable noise.
Approached LG service centre for a resolution but I am following them for past 18 days for a resolution. Complaint is moving from one executive to another but struggle continues.

Hope LG is reading this.

Buying an upgraded LG ac model replacing older has backfired this time.

Advice is think thrice before going for LG ac.",2
5085,"The smart features are oversold. LG's way of performing smart diagnosis is by using an audiomessage from the AC which is decoded on your phone. BUT THIS FEATURE ALSO ISNT APPLICABLE ON THIS AC.

The AC has the logo for smart diagnosis but it doesn't work.

The cooling worked in Bangalore heat for one day. Now it only reduces the humidity of my room but doesn't cool anything. Room temperature is still showing up at 30 degrees.

The remote does not have a backlight.
The AC doesn't close the intake valve when the power goes, it will only do that if the power is available. How hard was it to put a single battery that could have just done that as a fail safe?

The gas must have leaked during installation. The installation people aren't even bothering to look into my complaints. I can't even diagnose this AC myself, what rubbish in this age of smart technology! Do not buy this piece of rubbish.

UPDATE: So while my room is 250 sq ft, I can run this AC in the Viraat mode. It's effective that way. But it's still not worth the false advertising from LG.
Other problems: the Remote doesn't have a backlight. The AC flap doesn't close when the power goes. Would have been nice to have a small battery that did that much.",1
5086,"The delivery of the product was satisfied. But the installation of the AC by LG Thiruvalla was pathetic, terrible and irresponsible. The installation process wasn't done by a professional way. They leave the plug without fixing the pin when asked about that they said we need to fix it but earlier on the customer care call they informed that they are carrying every equipments and will fix.It was irresponsible installation done by LG Thiruvalla.",2

5090,"LG is a pathetic company. I bought it's after some time it's flaps are not closing properly.
They don't do proper quality check for their products. After 6 months it's TV also stopped working. Never going to buy LG product again.",1
5091,"Ac was dilivered on time but guys be vigilent from installation guys, they charge too much. I think LG should provide free installation. Will write another review after using AC for few more days",2
5092,"My ac Noise is high,,i observed some LG ac's they are not giving noise,,",3
5093,"This AC is very poor in context of cooling. Everyone on the internet and other places will tell you that this company is good AC. But I will tell you that this particular AC is the worst at cooling. My cooler is cooling more in comparison with this LG AC.

Plus, this AC is ineffective and inefficient at cooling the whole room. Only through the way the air is blowing, you feel cool, which will also be very low.

If you have a complaint regarding the cooling of the product, you will have multiple service engineers visit, they will just check the grill temperature and measure the ampere and will tell you that device is good, even though this Machine is completely failure, they will also tell that this AC is not cooling properly. But you can't do anything.
At last, you will feel that all your hard-earned money is gone in the trash. Because if you run this machine, only your electricity bill will increase, but in response to that, the cooling is nonsense.
I have complained multiple times. The service engineers are all inexperienced and of no use. The guarantee is also of no use.",1
5094,"I would say everything right from seller to order delivery to product to LG service center to all and all has troubled me in this. I would never order on Amazon and LG products as which is very bad. I wont recommend anyone to order it.
Also, by gods grace I understood how pathetic the LG service is. Copper pipe is missed in my LG AC which I received from Amazon and Installation member has come and checked and said Copper pipe is missed and he suggested to use from him and the amount need to paid by me, but surprisingly LG authorized service (Rama Enterprises, Pune) center guys are selling the Whirlpool copper pipe and they dont have LG copper pipe and upon checking with LG customer support, they said, dont allow to use any other branded pipe else you would lose the warranty. So what should one do, if LG authorized dealer is not maintaining their own branded spares, which is very funny. What if some repair has to be done in future and no spare is available at company authorized service center itself. Better to avoid such brands as there is no use other than wasting our money on their useless products.
DONT BUY LG PRODUCTS.",1

I have bought this LG only few months back. Since last 2 months I'm facing terrible issues and no technician is able to fix it.
1.Cooling issue: it's not cooling as per expectation. In my other room, I'm using marq cheap one ac which is working and cooling fine since 5 years.
2. Ch38 error: it keeps showing after sometime. Technician visits and refill the gas but not able to identify any leak. Now they have suggested no leak is there, you have to keep turning it on and off so that the error goes for sometime. This kind of resolution i dint expect from such populated brand.
Still now we are facing these 2 issue. It's been 2 months. As they couldn't able find any solution, they have stopped visiting now. And kept closing my complaints without any concerns.
My AC is still in warranty period. I asked since you are not able to fix then replace it. No body is responding..nobody is picking up the contacts customer care is sharing.
I am stuck with this 45k AC.
Please don't go for it for the sake of brand name.
I have sent mail to LG MD , to their main office. No responses !!
Horrible experience!!",1

5106,"I bought this AC for my kids' bedroom with high expectations. The wall unit made a rattling sound during installation , and the technician who installed had to call someone else to figure it out.

The AC lay unused for the next ten days as kids went on vacation. When they came back, we found it doesn't cool at all...probably a gas leak due to poor fitting. That is where my troubles began...the LG website doesn't even give you an sms or email confirmation of the ticket you've registered.

The technician who called up next day told me it's not his problem, and I should contact the technician who originally installed it. I did not anticipate I'd have to do this chasing around for a simple service request.

And oh, it turns out that this so called smart AC is not compatible with LG's MyThink App...go figure.",1
5107,"We bought this because of the high reviews online plus the assurance that LG will have a decent service network which will ensure quick installation. (WE have been Samsung customers for last 20 years mainly because of their service network, and we were under the impression that LG is at par. BIG MISTAKE).
The AC was delivered promptly and we received a call the very next day. Two guys turned up, insisted that the outside unit has to be kept on the terrace (about 6000 rupees extra for copper wire). This was for my parents home, and they live closeby so we went over immediately to see. After pointing out that all ACs unit in that society were installed in the balcony (just 900 odd rupees for the bracket) they quickly lost interest and left to apparently buy the bracket. They were absconding, leaving the AC open in the bedroom. We reached out to the agencies (Top One Services and Jeeves, I don't know if they are the same, but both were in touch for installation.) They sent another guy. He came up with the same suggestion of the terrace and yelled at my parents when they said no. After that another guy came and said he will bring the bracket - went absconding again. During this time, we were calling Amazon as well as LG continuously to escalate. After 4 days the LG customer service person says they have NO RECORD of my half a dozen calls while Amazon says LG will handle this in 2 days. Terribly disappointed with LG's ridiculously bad customer support. We are returning this product.

LG Electronics - I used to trust LG products for their longevity - Our First TV from LG is still working for 20 years

Two recent incidents made me question the entire credibility of LG and am not going to buy any LG products from now on

- We bought an LG TV a few months before and it stopped working they said it was due to the PCB board fault and I had to wait for a few months to get it repaired and fixed/replaced.

- Around the same time we bought an LG1.5-ton AC and yesterday it stopped working throwing some error code - After two service technicians visited - Now they said - the PCB board was faulty and I needed to wait a few months - as they had to send an email and get approval to replace it

While am continue to wait for any update",1

Seems some deffect on product maybe thia piece defected by LG.

When replacement came after a month the replacement AC was also damaged. So I asked for refund it's been over 1 month since I am waiting for refund. Still I have not received refund. Anwar who is area sales manager is too busy to help. The service center Technician are not skilled. So even tho LG is good brand. As no skilled technicians. This AC is only 0 star. Please don't buy LG AC. Even the replacement AC which came from godown is damaged. Summer is coming to an end but I still have not received my refund. And after paying money no AC. My money is stuck in their refund process and they are not releasing it to me. They are fraud. Please don't buy LG.
Also my old AC needs repairs and they said one month ago they need some parts and ordered the parts. It's just over a month now and they are still saying they didn't receive the parts. So my old AC is not repaired either. They are not able to fix their ACs. There is something terribly wrong with this company.

5120,"The LG air conditioning unit I received was an absolute nightmare from the moment I unpacked it. Let me share my terrible experience so that others can avoid making the same mistake. I have never been more disappointed with a purchase in my entire life.

The unit was dead on arrival. The unit never worked. Either Amazon or LG don't want to take the accountability and refund or arrange a return. Amazon customer service just keeps transferring the calls / chats to multiple departments and eventually disconnects the calls. LG kept saying they'll fix the unit for the last 3 months with no one turning up. My 50000 for this unit is a dead investment.

It's mind-boggling how a supposedly reputable brand like LG could manufacture such a faulty and shoddy product. Furthermore, the unit's remote control was an absolute joke.

Last but not least, the customer support from LG was abysmal. I reached out to them multiple times to address these issues, but they provided zero assistance. It was like talking to a brick wall. They were unresponsive, indifferent, and showed no willingness to resolve the problems I encountered with their defective unit.

In conclusion, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and steer clear of this LG air conditioning unit. It's an absolute piece of junk that fails to deliver even the most basic functionality. Don't be fooled by the brand name; this product is a disgrace. Spare yourself the headache and invest in a more reliable and reputable air conditioner from a different manufacturer. You'll thank me later.",1

Isn't service associated with the overall product and the brand?
It is almost a week and counting since I rescheduled installation support service but no sign of the technician.

Later A lady kept calling for the happiness code . Initially I didn't want to share the code as i was not satisfied. But later I gave it. As they kept calling",1
5148,"Not satisfy with product , it take very much time cool the room,",1
5149,"I am disappointed with the performance of the air conditioner I purchased. While the product delivery and installation process were hassle-free, the air conditioner itself is not functioning properly. It frequently shuts down unexpectedly and fails to provide adequate cooling.

In my attempt to seek assistance, I reached out to the brand's customer service, and they promptly sent an engineer to assess the issue. The engineer determined that the air conditioner has low coolant pressure, which is likely causing the malfunction. This leaves me unsure as to who is at fault for this situation: whether Amazon sent me a faulty product, or if the installation process was not carried out correctly.

Overall, while the delivery and installation experience were satisfactory, the ongoing performance issues with the air conditioner have left me disappointed.",2
5150,Lg technician behaviour very rude they asked high amount for installation already am having copper wire installed for old ac but they won't accept for tat technician asked to install new copper wire otherwise we won't install you won't get warranty and even manager also talked rudely plz don't buy lg products worst customer support,1
5151,"Very poor..After 2 months of running, HC error coming, not very great experience with all the LG products that I have used till now like Washing machine, Freeze and now AC.",1
5152,"Using Fake gas & copper pipe:
The service center (Royal Services Goa) used local copper pipes, several leftover pieces of insulation (instead of one continuous roll), and it seems they filled the AC with fake gas. AC was using full power but not cooling at all, the inside room temperature was higher than outside temperature & they were knowingly reporting wrong gas pressures to LG to cover up. I sent the pictures of the correct gas pressure to LG but the ASM took no action & service center stopped providing service and then closed the complaint. The installation technician also showed me samples of poor-quality copper pipes which he admitted were not from LG but from the local shop.

Overcharging & Arm twisting:
Service center said official company rates are for showing only. If I wanted officially published rates, the installation will not happen. That is exactly what they did. They kept me waiting for 10 days and then closed the complaint with reason ""customer does not want installation"" even though the matter was under escalation to with CEO's e-mail address.

Excess charges:
Extra Copper Pipe with insulation & vinyl tape: Official Rate 850/meter, Service center wanted: 1130 + gst
Power chord: Official Rate 60/meter, Service center wanted 180/meter
Gas refilling charge on brand new installation: Official rate: Free, its included, Service center wanted: 1500 + GST

Even after the matter was raised with the Area Service Manager (ASM), the ASM instead of upholding official rates said its not profitable for the service center & wanted me to directly negotiate unofficial rates with the service center.

AC not installed in 10 days:
Since I insisted on official installation prices, the service center stopped responding to calls or messages. The matter was escalated to the ASM but nothing changed.

Useless customer care:
The matter was escalated using the write to CEO link. This turned to be a total waste of time as you only get directed to customer care and get generic responses. They forwarded my complaint to the persons against whom the complaint was made. No one from LG customer care even called to find out whats going on & the harassment only increased. Amazon also escalated the issue at their end but the installation was not done in 10 days. Finally, I gave up and returned the AC.

This review is from someone who used to be a loyal LG customer. But now LG is not what it used to be.",1
5153,"Cooling, efficiency, everything is good but the copper pipe was missing in the amazon package. Had to pay for the pipe and then calim the refund from amazon. Amazon provides refund in the form of amazon pay balance which was waste of money.",3
5154,"Product is good but installing this thing is nightmare. Installation is done by brand itself on amazon & by third party installer on another e-commerce website. Brand installation is alway bad.
After hundreds of calls to LG, I received first technician visit after 7 days of delivery, when technician came to home, he told me he didn‚Äôt carry any proper rotary hammer drill and having only drill machine and mechanical hammer to make a hole, I refused to install as this could damage wall.
Again after hundreds of calls to LG, three days later another technician visited, this time he was very professional and had all the tools.
So yeah, I recommend this product to someone who have a lot of patience. Product seems good after one week of uses.",3
5155,Good,3
5156,"The product is really good and nice cooling, less noise. For installation they charge more than what's shown on Amazon app. Standard installation they charge 1415 and we have to pay extra for stand and the three pin plug and other accessories and for installation of the outdoor unit stand separately which was around 1200. LG sent an installation service fee bill of Rs.2596 but the service team charged me more. I wish the right expectations were set before installation about the charges, hence writing it here, it may cost around 3k for installation alone!! Not a fair price!!",3
5157,"Overall its a good product, but the ocean black protection is missing in indoor coils , and also the gold protection is missing in the u bends of the outer condenser coil.",3
5158,"Purchased the AC last week.Installation was a pain .Everyday someone claiming to be from LG would call only for not to turn up.Finally after 5 days a guy who pretended to be AC technician visited for installation.The guy was more suited for road construction rather than AC installation.He neither had patience to explain anything nor he had any skills to carry out installation.Left without giving Demo.For an AC costing north of 40k Atleast LG should send someone who knows the job.
Coming to the AC,it does work properly.There is no backlight in Remote which can be irritating at night without lights.AC is almost soundless ,cools my 140 sq feet room within 10-15 mins.",3
5159,Product Quality is good but service needs to be improved. I bought the AC along with stands(AC bracket) in Amazon but the service techinicans did not accept that to install and they asked me Rs. 300 extra for that otherwise I need to buy their products which costs Rs.1000 it seems. I bought 2 ACs and I lost around Rs. 500 and I tried to call Amazon and LG service centre but noresponsw from them. Please improve the service.,3

Not satisfied with the quality.
Doesn't cool fast and less cooling as compare to others.
I have samsung AC as well been using for 3 years, cools faster and make room SHIMLA within 10-15 mins.
LG claims that it consumes less Watts, but didn't see much difference as compare to Samsung AC.
Bought Samsung AC for less than the price of LG AC (almost 10k less )and it is older than LG AC, yet faster cooling and totally value for money and satisfied.
Don't go for LG AC.
LG AC has VIRAT mode as well. Just faster the Fan speed and does nothing.",2

5166,"I bought this AC in May 2024 and have been using it for couple of weeks now. Earlier I had a 10 yrs old 1.5 ton fixed speed Carrier AC, deployed in my living room/kitchen area with a size of approx 150 sq ft and it would chill the room. This LG AC is able to moderate the temperature to some extent but the air flow is barely noticeable even in HC mode, till the time I am sitting in front of it. This AC does not justify the steep cost!
Since, I have to run it in highest power setting or so called Virat mode all the time, I don't notice the difference in spends vs my old AC. Probably it is good for room size of 120 sq ft or less. Not impressed.
I think a Carrier or Blue star would be a better option.
I am now buying a fixed speed Windows AC from Carrier for my bedroom. Avoid Inverter ACs wherever you can.",2

Product and service may be good (not yet tested) but overall satisfaction is more important. We may not mind paying an extra buck for the important/essential accessories along with the product which may save us from headaches if the installation happens when elderly people or home care personnel at home.",3
5173,"Firstly I believed LG is best for its products until I experience their worst service experience .... Recently we purchased this AC for installation they sent some third party technician(outside mechanics) they didn't installed properly they didn't even gave receipt for our payment, the Ac condition was not so good for cooling it's takes minimum 20mins, later with some issue we contacted LG customer care services startingly they responded well but after ey didn't even send technician even a week after raising our issue, we're contacting customer care but later they not even responding to our calls ...please don't take this product as ur choice and coming to their service very very bad ...hope this review will helpfull to you... thankyou",1

4. Cost of operation is only slightly less compared to 3 star AC. Not much benefit if you use regularly. My electricity bill haven't reduced much.",1

After warranty, I mean after 1 year 4 months, indoor unit coil has leakage. If I want to repair these issues, I need to invest Rs. 20,000/- (Coil, Gas charges, PCB board and service changes.). My strong Recommendation is don't buy this product. And also Seller is also not trustable.",1

Cooling is good but the outdoor unit humming sound is very high, it is very uncomfortable noise.
Approached LG service centre for a resolution but I am following them for past 18 days for a resolution. Complaint is moving from one executive to another but struggle continues.

Hope LG is reading this.

Buying an upgraded LG ac model replacing older has backfired this time.

Advice is think thrice before going for LG ac.",2
5185,"The smart features are oversold. LG's way of performing smart diagnosis is by using an audiomessage from the AC which is decoded on your phone. BUT THIS FEATURE ALSO ISNT APPLICABLE ON THIS AC.

The AC has the logo for smart diagnosis but it doesn't work.

The cooling worked in Bangalore heat for one day. Now it only reduces the humidity of my room but doesn't cool anything. Room temperature is still showing up at 30 degrees.

The remote does not have a backlight.
The AC doesn't close the intake valve when the power goes, it will only do that if the power is available. How hard was it to put a single battery that could have just done that as a fail safe?

The gas must have leaked during installation. The installation people aren't even bothering to look into my complaints. I can't even diagnose this AC myself, what rubbish in this age of smart technology! Do not buy this piece of rubbish.

UPDATE: So while my room is 250 sq ft, I can run this AC in the Viraat mode. It's effective that way. But it's still not worth the false advertising from LG.
Other problems: the Remote doesn't have a backlight. The AC flap doesn't close when the power goes. Would have been nice to have a small battery that did that much.",1
5186,"The delivery of the product was satisfied. But the installation of the AC by LG Thiruvalla was pathetic, terrible and irresponsible. The installation process wasn't done by a professional way.

5193,"This AC is very poor in context of cooling. Everyone on the internet and other places will tell you that this company is good AC. But I will tell you that this particular AC is the worst at cooling. My cooler is cooling more in comparison with this LG AC.

Plus, this AC is ineffective and inefficient at cooling the whole room. Only through the way the air is blowing, you feel cool, which will also be very low.

If you have a complaint regarding the cooling of the product, you will have multiple service engineers visit, they will just check the grill temperature and measure the ampere and will tell you that device is good, even though this Machine is completely failure, they will also tell that this AC is not cooling properly. But you can't do anything.
At last, you will feel that all your hard-earned money is gone in the trash. Because if you run this machine, only your electricity bill will increase, but in response to that, the cooling is nonsense.
I have complained multiple times. The service engineers are all inexperienced and of no use. The guarantee is also of no use.",1
5194,"I would say everything right from seller to order delivery to product to LG service center to all and all has troubled me in this. I would never order on Amazon and LG products as which is very bad. I wont recommend anyone to order it.
Also, by gods grace I understood how pathetic the LG service is. Copper pipe is missed in my LG AC which I received from Amazon and Installation member has come and checked and said Copper pipe is missed and he suggested to use from him and the amount need to paid by me, but surprisingly LG authorized service (Rama Enterprises, Pune) center guys are selling the Whirlpool copper pipe and they dont have LG copper pipe and upon checking with LG customer support, they said, dont allow to use any other branded pipe else you would lose the warranty. So what should one do, if LG authorized dealer is not maintaining their own branded spares, which is very funny. What if some repair has to be done in future and no spare is available at company authorized service center itself. Better to avoid such brands as there is no use other than wasting our money on their useless products.

I have bought this LG only few months back. Since last 2 months I'm facing terrible issues and no technician is able to fix it.
1.Cooling issue: it's not cooling as per expectation. In my other room, I'm using marq cheap one ac which is working and cooling fine since 5 years.
2. Ch38 error: it keeps showing after sometime. Technician visits and refill the gas but not able to identify any leak. Now they have suggested no leak is there, you have to keep turning it on and off so that the error goes for sometime. This kind of resolution i dint expect from such populated brand.
Still now we are facing these 2 issue. It's been 2 months. As they couldn't able find any solution, they have stopped visiting now. And kept closing my complaints without any concerns.
My AC is still in warranty period. I asked since you are not able to fix then replace it. No body is responding..nobody is picking up the contacts customer care is sharing.
I am stuck with this 45k AC.
Please don't go for it for the sake of brand name.

The technician who called up next day told me it's not his problem, and I should contact the technician who originally installed it. I did not anticipate I'd have to do this chasing around for a simple service request.

The AC was delivered promptly and we received a call the very next day. Two guys turned up, insisted that the outside unit has to be kept on the terrace (about 6000 rupees extra for copper wire). This was for my parents home, and they live closeby so we went over immediately to see. After pointing out that all ACs unit in that society were installed in the balcony (just 900 odd rupees for the bracket) they quickly lost interest and left to apparently buy the bracket. They were absconding, leaving the AC open in the bedroom. We reached out to the agencies (Top One Services and Jeeves, I don't know if they are the same, but both were in touch for installation.) They sent another guy. He came up with the same suggestion of the terrace and yelled at my parents when they said no. After that another guy came and said he will bring the bracket - went absconding again. During this time, we were calling Amazon as well as LG continuously to escalate.

LG Electronics - I used to trust LG products for their longevity - Our First TV from LG is still working for 20 years

Two recent incidents made me question the entire credibility of LG and am not going to buy any LG products from now on

- Around the same time we bought an LG1.5-ton AC and yesterday it stopped working throwing some error code - After two service technicians visited - Now they said - the PCB board was faulty and I needed to wait a few months - as they had to send an email and get approval to replace it

5220,"The LG air conditioning unit I received was an absolute nightmare from the moment I unpacked it. Let me share my terrible experience so that others can avoid making the same mistake. I have never been more disappointed with a purchase in my entire life.

The unit was dead on arrival. The unit never worked. Either Amazon or LG don't want to take the accountability and refund or arrange a return. Amazon customer service just keeps transferring the calls / chats to multiple departments and eventually disconnects the calls. LG kept saying they'll fix the unit for the last 3 months with no one turning up. My 50000 for this unit is a dead investment.

It's mind-boggling how a supposedly reputable brand like LG could manufacture such a faulty and shoddy product. Furthermore, the unit's remote control was an absolute joke.

Last but not least, the customer support from LG was abysmal. I reached out to them multiple times to address these issues, but they provided zero assistance. It was like talking to a brick wall. They were unresponsive, indifferent, and showed no willingness to resolve the problems I encountered with their defective unit.

In conclusion, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and steer clear of this LG air conditioning unit. It's an absolute piece of junk that fails to deliver even the most basic functionality. Don't be fooled by the brand name; this product is a disgrace. Spare yourself the headache and invest in a more reliable and reputable air conditioner from a different manufacturer.

I received the message that the service is from PRIDE Service which may be a third party but the LG's own customer service is quite useless. No track of issue, no updates, no follow ups.. what's the point of a supposedly 5 star product if you can't get a proper support for it. Isn't service associated with the overall product and the brand?
It is almost a week and counting since I rescheduled installation support service but no sign of the technician. The local service centre does not pick the call and to get some one in LG customer care is a nightmare. I would have returned the product and gone for another brand if I had the option to do so but unfortunately there is only replacement option.",1

In my attempt to seek assistance, I reached out to the brand's customer service, and they promptly sent an engineer to assess the issue. The engineer determined that the air conditioner has low coolant pressure, which is likely causing the malfunction. This leaves me unsure as to who is at fault for this situation: whether Amazon sent me a faulty product, or if the installation process was not carried out correctly.

Overall, while the delivery and installation experience were satisfactory, the ongoing performance issues with the air conditioner have left me disappointed.",2

5252,"I recently purchased the LG Air Conditioner dual inverter AC, and it has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. Here's why I wouldn't recommend this product:
1. Poor Cooling Performance: Despite the high price and impressive specifications, this air conditioner barely cools the room. Even at the lowest temperature setting, it struggles to make a noticeable difference, especially on hotter days.
2. Energy Inefficiency: My electricity bill skyrocketed after using this air conditioner for just one month. It consumes an excessive amount of power, which is both environmentally unfriendly and expensive.
3. Unreliable Performance: The air conditioner frequently stops working without warning. I've had to reset it multiple times, and customer service has been unhelpful in resolving these issues. It's clear that there are significant reliability problems with this model.
4. Poor Customer Service: Speaking of customer service, my interactions with the company have been frustrating. Long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and no satisfactory solutions to my issues. It‚Äôs been a nightmare trying to get any support or assistance.
5. In summary, the LG Air Conditioner dual inverter AC Air Conditioner has been a major letdown in every aspect. From its poor cooling capabilities and excessive noise to its high energy consumption and unreliable performance, I regret purchasing this product. Save your money and look for a more reliable and efficient air conditioner.

please have a look at AC remote, even after runnning 3 hrs continuously, Room Temperature is 31 degree",1
5253,"I've been using this ac from more than a year, but from the starting ac performance is not good, it takes 3-4 hours to take the temperature down of the room from 32 to 24 in peak summers, haven't s seen room temperature to go below 20 degrees irrespective of no of hours when inset it to lowest 16 degrees.
Pros: service is good by LG",3
5254,Indoor unit is small as we think 3 star only difference is unit consumption,3
5255,"Bought this product from HSR Layout, Bengaluru.

Delivery (Amazon Executive) :
Very good, very professional.

Installation (LG Technician):
Highly unprofessional, rude, lacks technical knowledge and common sense.
They have absolutely no idea about indoor electrical pipes or any aesthetics of final fittings.
They were fitting the indoor unit leaving only 4 inches (approx 8 to 10 cm) space from ceiling, whereas it is clearly written that a minimum gap of 20 cm needs to be left from the ceiling while fitting the indoor unit.
They do not use the circular cup drill for the large wall hole, they use the small drill bit and make multiple holes and then use a hammer and chisel to make a larger than required hole, significantly damaging the wall more than required.
They do not vaccum the system before opening the gas, after fitting the outdoor unit.
The outdoor unit was installed slanting, not straight.
No product demo was given. The technician didn't know how to use the remote not did he know about multiple functions and modes.
AC was not run on test mode for 18 mins either.
I had to learn myself from YouTube.
Installation technician was rude and threatened to not do the work when we tried to correct him.

Product performance:
Been using this product for 3 days now, it's fairly good, cools a 170 sqfeet room from 32 C in 5 to 10 mins in the VIRAT mode.
The AC is very very quiet, and sustained cooling at 24 C is pretty good.
A silent sleek fast cooling AC with a lot of features for optimum comfort and energy efficiency.

Additional costs:
Installation fees ‚Çπ1414
Brackets ‚Çπ870
PVC vinyl tape ‚Çπ300
White cement ‚Çπ50
3 PIN Plug 15 Amps ‚Çπ100
Additional charges for additional copper pipe and outlet pipe(if needed)

Final thoughts - The performance and efficiency and longevity of an air conditioner solely depends on how well it has been installed. AC installation is a highly technical process, and LG has done a major cost cutting when it comes the installation technician .

Will recommend to get the Blue star AC or something else from a nearby dealership like Relaince , which has much more professional installation.",2
5256,"Performance of AC is good but giving 3 stars because of Remote and installation experience. Remote is not illuminated and don‚Äôt have backlight for the display. It is difficult to find or use during night time. This being non WIFI model, LG should have provided this basic option.

Regards to installation, had a horrible experience. First of all the installation happened only after 5 days of delivery that too after escalation to LG. The service person did not even had basic items like insulation tape or hacksaw blade and asking us to provide. They charged 150 rupees additional to use a bag while drilling the wall so that the debris fall into the bag and the room stays clean but all the debris fell into the room and when requested to remove they said it is not their duty but charged 150 rupees to use a bag to keep the room clean which is useless. I would not recommend this product just for the above reasons rather go for Indian companies that gives product with value for money and good customer experience.",3
5257,"no sounds ac working smoothly and better cooling what I expected as per my room. But Amazon delivery service is not good product damaged what I attached in images. LG team service person also conveyancing to adjust product there is no issue about cap.

This is the new product OR Amazon selling a second hand refurbished items.

After looking to my review Amazon team only answer OR LG team respond to react immediately about his own new product.",3
5258,"I strongly recommend reading this review before making a purchase. I've never written a negative review before, but this experience compelled me to share.

Delivery:

The delivery service from Amazon was extremely disappointing. As I was traveling internationally, my 68-year-old father assisted the delivery personnel. Despite providing clear instructions for the delivery address, the delivery person was rude upon arrival. My father requested that the AC unit be placed on the first floor. The delivery person outright refused, stating, ""It wasn't mentioned to place it on the first floor. You can move it yourself. We won't do it,"" and left.

Expecting a senior citizen to carry an AC unit to the first floor without assistance is unacceptable. The delivery terms stated that two delivery personnel would place the AC where instructed. Currently, the AC is still lying outside our garage where they left it.

Installation:

I purchased this AC because my wife is pregnant and we wanted a comfortable environment for her in India. Despite this urgent need, it has been over six days without any contact from the brand for installation.

I've contacted LG customer care multiple times over the past three days. Each time, I was told, ""The service center has confirmed the AC will be installed today. You'll receive a call shortly."" However, I never received any such call. My frustration with the customer service representatives was met with vague assurances, making it clear they either lack the necessary personnel or are running a scam.

Why Scam?

My nephew ordered the same AC model with a 3-star configuration on the same day as mine. He also received no contact from the installation team. After five days, he resorted to a local vendor for installation. Immediately after the installation was completed, he received a call from the brand‚Äôs engineer. When my nephew explained the situation, the engineer threatened to void the warranty since the installation wasn't done by them. To preserve the warranty, he had to pay the engineer INR 1400 to mark the installation as complete.

This practice seems like a scheme to make money without effort, especially by frustrating elderly customers.

Given the poor installation service, I doubt the warranty is even worth having, as they are unlikely to honor it.

Due to this ongoing disappointment, I am returning this AC. I strongly advise anyone in urgent need of an AC to contact local vendors rather than purchasing online.

Product Review:

I never got to experience it!!

About the product works pretty well, I like the silent mode! The High cooling mode is noisy. Good you can turn of the display.
Will try to review after a month again.

Update after 4 months..something is not right..the cooling doesn't work the way it shud.. the tech visits and says no problem..but does not work as per expectations. Better to find a store near you and get em installed..

2 people came for installation,but the great part was to they are not from the company they are from some third party who was there for warrenty. They installed the AC,from the next day the entire pipe line even the AC was leaking. There was a water leakage everywhere. We made a complaint on the brand support and they are arguing with us only and bleaming us that why we have done the installation from third party but the same has been sent from you guys. After so many arguments they agreed to send someone to check the leackeg. Then someone came again from third party and mentioned so many things like, the installation was not properly done, the pipe quality was bad and many more stuff. Now the real struggle started each and every day we got a call that someone was coming to check but no one came for 15 days, my entire family was so stressed about the fact that we feel cheated. My brother contacted the third party manager and that person was showing like he was giving us a favor for listening us .
We had to explain the entire story every time to every individual.
There was a extend warranty and someone came to check the AC and just for visiting he charged, but the product was still in warranty.

5272,"Here is my review of this product that will help you decide this ac
1. My installation was perfect and guys are also good.
2. Cooling is good. I cant say it super-chills the room in a 10 minutes. This is subjective things. It depends on the wall and insulation and size of the room. If you have one floor building and there is direct sunlight on the room then it will take time. It will be better if you run the ac on viraat mode for 30 minutes and then switch to lower convertible mode.
3. Ac is really very silent. You will hear blower sound if ac is running on full capacity (Viraat Mode)
4. Look is premium
5. Electricity consumption is also subjective thing. It depends on the room and cooling.

Biggest cons
The biggest cons of this ac down flap.
Ac flap is not getting down completely. TI will come to mid and goes up. As per lg this is intended behaviour of all AC.
If someone is below ac then he will not get chilling experience . If your bed is below the ac you will not get super pleasant feel.

On the day of installation, I told the installation person that the ac is not cooling much. He asked me to wait for a day as it is a new ac and inverter acs take some time to cool the room. I was in a dilemma if there something wrong with the model I have selected or weather is too hot outside which was causing the cooling issue. I bought Lloyd for another room a week back, which is also 1.5 ton and to my surprise it cooled the room in 2 minutes. Then I realised it is the issue with LG AC and raised customer support request. Service person came and said that I will have to clean the filter of ac every week to make the ac work. I was so frustrated and asked him to clean and see if the ac works as expected. He cleaned it and put the ac on 16 degrees and waited for 15 minutes and room temperature was still 26.. he started saying that because it is summer and temperature is high outside it is not cooling. I took him to the other room and showed how the other ac is working. He did not fix anything or suggested anything and went away. I have literally wasted my money in this product",1

Problem start post Installation. I logged call for engineer site visits. After calling customer care 4-5 times for the status of my call logged, everytime I got assurance that engineer will connect me shortly which never Happened. I got surprised that after 15-20 days of continues follow-up, my service request was closed without my knowledge. They people not even bothered to at least connect me before closing my request.

5287,"From my experience I would suggest not to go for LG barnded ACs. One month back I bought LG 1.5 Ton 3 . Star AI DUAL Inverter Split AC. After 5 days of delivery engineer came and installed and gave demo and left, after 30min from the indoor unti water started dropping even though it was cooling the room. I called the same engineer he did not come so next day I raised one complain. The service negineer came and said sir chassis need to be changed which may take 2-3days based on availability of equipment. After lots of followup after 11days they they came with chassis and checked again and said sir its not chassis rather cooling compartment needed to chang. Again i waited for around 12days. Every time I call customer care they will say we will send a esclation mail, at last they gave one number and asked me to speak. That person is saying sir PO has been raised material has to reach. In the mean while now AC is not cooling anymore. By the time I am writing this I am still waiting to get this repaired.
Just to add on in month Jan 2023 I bought another LG 5 star dual inverter AC as well for my other house, but that was offline. That was installed by LG engineer but after around 40days of installation it stopped cooling. When I raised complain the engineer came and did high level inspection and told while installation they might have done something wrong. After 2days again they came and checked by opening and said no sir installation is ok but gas is not there when I asked if installation is OK then how gas leak happened he said some story like sir it is very hot and humid outsied sometimes it happens. I was really surprised to here.
So out of these two LG AC experience I would suggest better go for other better brand though I can not suggest which brand as I am not an expert.
But one suggestion if you are purchasing LG brand then do installation by their engineer else they will put all problem on those guys and deny for providing free solution within the warranty period.",1

Amazon never supported a 10-day exchange just a headline.

Now LG, I bought a product which is more expensive than its peers, just for the sake of service, LG also denied replacement, and took around 10 days, that too when I wrote to the CEO's office LG, for 10 days, from the guy who installed to the last visit, they were just trying to convince me that AC is fine,
i had to call, write, and attend multiple calls daily to get work done.

However, finally, they opened ODU and fixed it, I ended up getting a faulty product that can stop working anytime, despite paying the best.

I will give up my prime subscription, As Amazon's policies are not worth at all.",1
5296,"I have ordered AC on last week and installed yesterday and observed:
1. No cooling effect of LG AC.. very bad cooling
So not recommended to purchase this AC
2. Too much charges for installation without showing standard rate card and applied other charge

A. Installation charge: 1299+GST = 1416rs
B. Extra 5 feet Copper pipe : = 1875 rs
C. Drain Pipe plastic 4 metre. = 424 rs
D. Cable 5 feet. = 365 rs
E. Wrapping tape. = 400 rs

But actual cost of material in shop
B: Copper pipe 170 rs / feet = 850 rs
C. Drain pipe. 25 rs / feet = 125 rs
D. Cable. 20 rs / feet. = 100 rs

So be alert and better way to arrange your own material from hardware shop instead of taking from AC installation team.",1

1.Enjoy the benefits of LG's Skilled Engineers talking care of your product

3.Performing proper vacum for faster cooling & better performance
4.Better look,proper laying of insulation to connecting tubes
5.Vinyl tapping on piping
6.Hole properly closed with White cement / POP - No Insect entry / rat bite

What they have done is
1. Vaccum was not done
2.holes were not sealed
3.taping was not proper.
4. Rubber bushes were not placed between the outdoor unit and ac stand which I bought from them. (Rubber bushes are sleeping on my drawer - may be it's not needed but why should company provides that)

As far as AC is concerned please go for who is providing proper installation as the quality and performance relies on installtion quality only.
Brand and it's cost nothing to do with the cooling and mostly all brands are same.

5304,"No cooling, worst customer experience, bad product, words can not describe how sad I am to put my hard earned income into this AC, which I never ever got any satisfaction after using it. Totally not a value for money.

I am not sure, why Amazon is hosting products like this and vendors who cheat customers. I am so regretful about this.

First Amazon forgets to ship the essential part of this AC, which is also tagged to be shipped together with this, the 4 mm copper pipe, and when installation team came for setting up the AC, they charged me extra for that pipe, when I called Amazon, they declined to give any support or send the missing components, they gave me a terrible gift voucher, which I never redeemed.

When I call Amazon customer care, they ask to call product care, when I call LG service center they ask to call local repair, when the local repairer comes they do not pay attention to solving the problem, and leave. And then the cycle repeats.

Now, the AC is completely broken, I have had more than six services and two repair sessions on this from LG repairers, but the problem persists.

If anyone reads this, please do not buy this product its a waste of money. Also, do not make the mistake of trusting this Vendor.

b. Poor Customer service: Absolutely disappointing. They don‚Äôt acknowledge that it's not working, just make minor adjustments, and never follow up.
c. High Energy Bills: Does it even save on the electricity bill? Come on, LG team‚Äîthis product is a total failure.

Also, the indoor unit seems like it‚Äôs 1ton as it is shorter than the normal 1.5tons indoor units. I clarified with service people who installed it but they said it‚Äôs not written in the unit and they installed.

The star here is for amazon. Buying on amazon is such a peace of mind. The product was delivered to me and then after reading the specs on the box i decided that this ac will be insufficient for my room.

2. As this AC is very small size, it is fitted in some part of the room, actual problem starts from here. It doesn't have horizontal swing.

3. Worst design for indoor unit and its air flow, air flows only upwards

4. Remote has lot of buttons with no background light, while you are sleeping and want to change the something then you can't as you need to switch on the light and that will disturb everyone.

5352,"I am a loyal LG Customer and never faced any problem with their product. Their customer service has also been excellent throughout all these years. But this is the first time that I have faced an issue of manufacturing defect with LG AC. The AC was installed by the rookie technicians who did not check any leakage in the AC, perhaps assuming the brand reputation. Later, when I switched on the AC, it did not give any cooling. When I contacted customer care, the technicians visited and they checked that the gas had leaked. They checked the indoor and outdoor unit and even filled it with nitrogen gas to check for leakage. But as there was no leakage, they put new gas went away. Later, again the gas got leaked in three days. After that, today, again after raising the complaint, a specialist technician came and he saw that the cooling coil of the AC was damaged and the gas was leaking from that part. Earlier, all the technicians kept blaming our internal pipes at home for the leaks.
This technician told me that these 2023 models are reporting this issue of cooling coil leakages since the last two months. Fortunately, the product is under warranty and it would be replaced free of cost, otherwise since LG has started outsourcing the manufacturing of their products to local manufacturers, there are problems in the products.

In case you have also purchased any of the 2023 models, irrespective of features and weight, and you face a similar issue, tell the technician to check the cooling coil because these models are reporting this problem. I had to write this in review so that any buyer who is facing this issue would know the real issue behind the leakage.

UPDATE - LG recommended replacement of the product due to multiple leakages and Amazon turned it into a nightmare for me. It is not giving me the complete installation charges and even telling me that it can pay a small share of it only as an Amazon Pay GiftCard. Please do not buy any electronic product from Amazon because they will make it a nightmare for you. Buy from the local dealer. I have complained against Amazon to the National Consumer Helpline (INGRAMS). If you are also a victim of Amazon's thuggery, then you can complaint and pursue the matter forward.",1

A. The exchange value of the item will be determined by an independent agency at the time of pickup, therefore despite qualifying the criterias indicated in the checklist, it is subject to change, which was our experience - additionally unfortunately the pick up agent took extra charges from us. The customer care has raised the issue- and trying to resolve this.

2. The installation charges- it can be additional and go upto 5200. The LG service agent claimed that this is for additional copperwires and other materials deemed necessary by the engineer after inspection of the location and that this is standard across the country irrespective of the platform you purchase from.

I decided not to go for LG products for the rest of my life.

Bought this AC and the Brand installed it on 2nd of June. Product stopped working the next day!

Contacted the person on 3rd june, who installed the product and waited for them to visit and check, but there was no response from them further.

So i Registered a service request with LG on 4th where they mentioned it'll be attended in 72Hrs.. and waited politely for a day and when i checked with them on 5th, they replied that there was no request registered!! Was shocked to know that and i wanted to raise a request again on 5th. Till then there were no messages/ acknowledgements from LG support that a service request is raised.

I started following up with them 10 times a day about the status,(to make sure the request exists) where i was strictly told that it will take upto 72 hours and i literally begged with them to make it quick.

It is 8th of June today.. and when i called them today they said they cancelled my request. Reason they came up with is that there was an existing request for demo installation that was not closed. Does that make any sense.. Don't they know this when they accepted the request on 5th.

Tricky part is that they told me that they have raised a new request again today and guess what, i will have to wait for another 72 hours. Note that they didn't care about the pending demo request that was the reason for request cancellation and they have booked a new request now. Asked them if they are going to play the same game once again after 72 hours and they had no answers.

Coming to Amazon support, when i checked with them, they sounded like they don't have any grip on this and all they can do is raise a request with LG on our behalf and we will have to deal with LG.

It's 8th day and i'm literally begging and fighting with LG and Amazon all these days, but no one came to help so far.

Decision is yours's!!!!",1
5363,"First of all Amazon delivered two days later than delivery date so, if u can wait then order from Amazon. AC is good and cools room but not good at 46c. Necessary function all are given. This model has no WiFi.
Main problem is with LG service and installation. They give third party to install and the installation guy was very unprofessional. He didn't ask where u want to fit AC they do work as per their convenience. Won't recommend LG service. We pay extra for brand because of their services and sales support but LG has very poor services so I recommend to with other brand and save your money. Disappointment from LG. I have all the appliances from LG in my house but next I won't consider LG for my home. Don't buy products from so called brands if they doesn't justify our money.",2

The disappointing matter is about the after sales service. The AC got delivered on 27th March 2024, and since the technician didn't reported till 30th March 2024 ( after three days of delivery) I called Amazon customer service and reported the matter. Following this I recieved a call from the service partner of LG and informed that installation is scheduled on 1st April. Since the technican failed to turnup on 1st I called LG customer support and requested for an escalation of the complaint.

And finally on 2nd April Afternnon the technican came. A positive attitude and careful handling of the equipment at par with the reputation of the brand was expected from the service personnel but was infomed by my family that it was quite disappointing. It may be because of the escalation of the complaint and such a behaviour is completely unacceptable, from the customer point of view.

5368,"Product wise is ok
Technician are not upto the mark",3
5369,"I did a big mistake by ordering this LG AC. Please read the complete comment before going for this bug model AC. The feedback is after using it three months.
Worst Cooling:
This AC won't cool even though you keep it in 19 or 18.
Bought this AC in Mid-April (2023) and by first (Or Max second) month itself ,the cooling was not proper and we found some problem.

Wrong Built - Model:
The built of this AC itself is weird and I personally feel it is not suitable for the houses where there are no young/Mid aged ones around.
Reason being, every 10 days, you need to clean the filter of this AC which will be right at top.
It will be difficult as I ordered for my old parents and every time they must find someone to clean this by using ladder or something.
If you don't clean this filter, the AC wont cool.
Interestingly, this point was not mentioned in our demo, and we came to know about this once we raised a complaint about cooling issues the very next week after buying this one.
Service technician-Useless:
The service technician came as we raised a complaint for cooling related issue.
He created a new issue after the service, Water started leaking inside the room.(Refer the attached video).
AC attracts dust more than customers:
Refer the images no need to explain. Its just after 3 months usage and having a filter on top which is to avoid the dust but still lot of dust and every 2 months you have to call service guy.
In short: EVERY TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE TO CONTACT SERVICE WHICH IS ALSO USELESS.
FIRST THREE or FOUR ARE ONLY FREE.
Waste Training demo by LG.
Remote have lot of options (which god only knows) but what is the point when it is failing the basic thing which is to cool the room.

If possible, I will replace this by Carrier as we used it earlier and it is far far better than this LG..
Also, I am sure that all the ratings in social media by Youtube, Insta influencers are paid.

DONT BUY OTHERWISE YOU WILL REGRET LATER.
It is up to you.. :-)",1
5370,"I bought this LG 1 Ton 4 star 2024 model on 13 May 24. Since day one, Cooling is not proper even my room size is 110 Sq ft. Hence i talk to LG care for the same cooling issue. Technician came and checked. No issue was found. Technician suggested, its cooling can't be improved as this machine is only made for such Very low level cooling. Market gimmicks are made to lure customers. I Suggest, don't buy LG products. Can opt for Daikin, Haier, Lyod, Blue Star and many more but don't trust LG.",2
5371,"The copper kit was missing in the sealed box when opened by authorised installer. I paid Rs.3500-to the installer for the missing kit on 14 Mar. 24, to get the work completed. Yet to get the refund.",3
5372,"1) Product is good
2) No light in remote, difficult to use in night.
3) VERY HIGH INSTALLATION CHARGES. LG has assigned a third party vendor to do installation. They will charge almost double the amount for installation. For 7 feet extra pipe, they charged me almost Rs 5000, local AC technician had quoted approximately Rs 2500. The problem is your will not get warranty if it is installed by local technician. Secondly they will not give you bill post installation, you will have to ask them for Gst bill.",3
5373,Good cooling but it is very Noisy.,3
5374,"Cooling wise it's average for Bangalore weather, I expected it to be performing better. Side swing fan is a scam and it won't work as said. Coming to a large org like LG, it's a disgrace they are yet to even add this model to even register in there application and smart diagnosis is a scam as you can't even add this variant in that damn LGthinQ app. So it's a lie when they say it supports smart diagnosis and we can't connect AC to wifi even. So all in all highly disappointed with LG and it's brand of excellence",2
5375,"It's Dec 2023 model not 2024 model, just rec'd today, will update after installation and product experience.",3
5376,Order 3 ACs and all 3 came without the 3 meter copper wire which is part of the units,3
5377,"Remote holder is missing from the box , also technician collected more Money for the extra pipe and whatever we ask he is saying extra cost, technician collected total 5600 for the installation which I feel charges are more.
How do I get the remote holder now",3
5378,"I bought this AC after checking the features and reading some reviews. I forgot to focus on after sales service feedbacks.
The AC which was installed was not cooling properly. So I raised a request and a service engineer visited. The engineer said that the installation was not done properly by the local LG team. He will raise this and get it fixed. And from here started the wait.
No one showed up for 3 days. I reached out to LG over whatsapp. The agent there raised a complaint but again no one showed up. I checked everyday but the WhatsApp agent would just apologize that they are deeply sorry and escalating.
And this is still going...

All in all, buy an AC from a brand who has its service ops sorted like samsung.",1
5379,"The AC in good one. But the seller did not send cool paper pipe and installation kit which costs Rs. 4000. When I called Amazon, I was told that, Amazon will pay me back but after installation. When I shared the Job Sheet Amazon denied to pay for the installation kit(copper nut) which is of 400 rupees. So, I will suggest not buy from Amazon as the sellers here are not sending all components with the AC. Moreover, Amazon do not care about it and asks customers to pay from own pocket which is wrong. So be careful before you order from here.",1
5380,"The outer packing of the units is good. When opened the inner unit back shield found damaged. No doubt it was installed some where and was removed due to some reasons. while removing the inner unit, theback side tin shield got damaged. And the outer frame of the IU was also have a cut. No doubt it is an installed and removed unit. So it is very clear that I have purchased a secondhand AC for a highest(new) price. Shame on part of Amazon and LG for supplying such sort of goods for new price. Due to my urgent need I was forced to accept the product. I don't know how long it is durable.",3
5381,A little slower in cooling the small room . Takes time to chill in the hot summers .,3
5382,,3
5383,"Buy this AC only if you have time to constantly call their customer care, which is of course was no use for me. What they did was to raise some tickets, which the service center never saw. Also, one of the numbers provided by the care was always busy, another was never picked up or returned. Finally, after 3days of delivery, visited the service center physically, took the allotted persons reachable number, constantly followed up and got it installed. The service engineers were in a hurry (understandable), and just installed the AC without filling the hole or covering the pipes with the insulation tapes (provided) fully. They also charged me 1400+300 extra because I bought AC stand from outside. I had hole in the wall and 16A plug beforehand. After I have given not so good feedback, company is calling and asking why have I given 5/10 !! They also offered resolving the issues now, but no use now! So, please decide wisely!

AC is working fine, is silent, and energy efficient.",3
5384,"I called more than 10 times daily, after that they came and installed my ac , by LG technician very very worst installation , very they taken the copper pipe wrap , they missed the black rubber , they came at nyt , very very very worst experience by lg",2
5385,"This ac does not cool as fast as bluestar and ogeneral do (i have both). Duel inverter is just another luring technique. These other brand have more energy savings than LG. I would suggest if you want to spend this premium, I would recommend bluestar.",2
5386,"Dust Filter is at the top, if filter catches too much dust it won't cool at all. So every 15 days you have to clean filters for regular use.
I don't see this kind of issue with other ACs, even filter is dusty it will cool but a little less may be. But this model wont cool if flter is gets dusty.",2
5387,AC runs nicely yet installation period from delivery time needs improvement,3
5388,"After using a couple days I found some of the issues like., the room cooling takes lot of time it takes more than a 4hrs. Better go with whirlpool or some other brand other than LG.
Worst experience after usage.",1
5389,Everything of fine only installation is expensive.,3
5390,Product is good but missing coper wire in outside unit box. I am thinking delivery people stolen it. Lg company has to be pack properly.,3
5391,Product is ok but installation not good,2
5392,"I booked installation service and for some reason i had to cancel the appointment, and later on i applied for another date for installation and now these guys are not responding..... It has been 8 days since my ac was delivered and now they are simply ignoring me, never buy any LG product, they are incompetent and pathetic. Also they were asking for extra charges apart from installation charge to buy a new stand from them for keeping the out door unit, I already have my own stand, but still as per there term and conditions they will cost you extra 300rs just to screw that stand into wall. I am regretting after buying this product, i have no option left now, dont repeat my mistake.",1
5393,"The technician did not patch up the hole drilled for the ac installation and when I requested him to come back and fix it he refused and asked to go ahead and complain against him, with a I don't care attitude.",2
5394,It's one of the cheapest model of LG. The sound of the inner as well outer unit is quite high. You have to switch off the unit as the temperature falls below the set level.,2
5395,Copper wire was missing in the ac unit the cost of buying is high and even after following instructions refund is not credited to account since 2 weeks now,2
5396,Completely not happy. From the date of purchasing the AC the water leaking inside. Several times I have informed to the service centre they simply said not an issue it will solve automatically like they convincing me.then thay taken the product to the service station after two days they installed. Again the problem is not solved. Now again I am calling them but no response. My money is completely waste. No service support. Water leaking inside like a rain . kindly anyone help me.,1
5397,"why these many modes , not getting minimal cool when it is in normal mode , if we keep HC or AC modes then only it's getting cool and also room getting cool even after one hour , only getting cool if we stand or sit straight at blade level",2
5398,External unit has gas leakage issue. The day I installed I started giving issues but service guy told gas low so he filled but again it leaked. Than 3 4 times service engineer tried but not able to find the leakage. Now they told external unit has the leakage so they have take to the service center. Not a great experience with lg this time. latest update is that they have repaired external unit and now it's working fine. Only concern when we are buying new AC so we don't expect any leakage on the first day.,3
5399,We bought 3 months back and it started leaking. The maintenance guy who came he fooled us telling dirt was going inside but again it started leaking 40k spending and this is happening with this ac pls dont but.,1
5400,"The Good Product quality gets the star, however the other 4 stars LG lost is due to very unprofessional installation and Service team!! The installation guys literally sit and Stand on the Outdoor unit for an example of their way of work!! Installation guys cut the copper tubes that came with AC shortening it to add more extra tube!! There was a leakage of gas and they had to redo the installation and gas fill up!! The Copper tube insulation given with extra payment is also useless, lot of condensation on pipe that is making walls wet!! The installation woes go on!! I will choose other AC products for next time for sure!! Only good products won‚Äôt deliver success LG need to have good Service and support team as well!!",1
5401,"I initially had high hopes for this AC unit, especially with its promising 40% capacity feature. However, my experience has been far from satisfactory. While the 40% capacity setting is convenient for energy efficiency, I've encountered a significant flaw: the unit often switches from 40% to 100% capacity automatically, halting its cooling function altogether.

This inconsistency not only defeats the purpose of the energy-saving mode but also disrupts the comfort of the indoor environment. It's incredibly frustrating to have the unit suddenly stop cooling when it's needed most, leading me to give it a rating of one star.

I urge the manufacturer to address this issue promptly to enhance the reliability and performance of their product. Until then, I cannot recommend this AC unit to others.",1
5402,Costly but Avarage performance,2
5403,"received the AC but the 3m length copper pipe is missing. I had to buy seperately. These pipes are costly items!! I read some comments and found that a number of people faced this issue of missing copper pipes!!!
No complaints about the working of AC but the installation process is tedious and costly, LG needs to work on this a bit.
Would have given 5 starts for AC but the installation is quite costly and missing items resulted in 3 rating.",3
5404,"Update-4
Purchased Panasonic AC instead and they installed it one day before the promised date. As of now cannot comment on it's performance as I haven't used it much but installation was quick and smooth.

********************************************************
Update-3
After 10 days of delivery and 4-5 days of returning the AC, today one person called from the LG service center and asked me if the AC had been delivered to me. That's the level of synchronization LG team has with their service centers. I am genuinely happy for getting rid of this brand.

**************************************
Update - 2
After six days of waiting, LG didn't respond for installation. Amazon also gave up and could not get LG install the AC. Eventually Amazon accepted the return request and AC has been picked up by Amazon for return.
That's LG for you. If you are still going for LG then be ready to learn from your own mistake.

*******************
Update - 1
It's fourth day and after multiple calls, emails and tweets to LG customer care and many escalations, still no response from LG for installation. Now Amazon is also denying to return this AC.

*******************
After purchasing this AC, in a city like Kolkata, no call from LG regarding installation even after two days. I called LG Customer Care many a times but all they are doing is recording and transferring of complaints from one place to other without getting it installed. Now, after finding it impossible to get this AC installed by LG in a metro city, I am going to place a return for this product on Amazon and will go for some other brand.
If you are buying an LG AC, you are vary much going to regret it even before you get a chance to use it.",1
5405,Indoor unit delivering some odd small and no effective cooling. It takes very long time to bring down by 1 unit.,2
5406,"I purchased this air conditioner one month ago, but I am not satisfied with its performance. It is not cooling properly, and I have raised a service request. However, after 24 hours, the technician has not communicated with me. When I try to call him, his phone is temporarily out of service. I do not recommend this product. If you are planning to buy a split AC, please consider other brands such as Voltas or Blue Star. The quality of LG products and their service has declined, so I advise against purchasing an LG air conditioner.",1
5407,"I am using LG 5 star 1 ton AC from 2008 , which is running smoothly even after 16 years. Purchased one LG 5 star 1 ton dual inverter AC 2024 model on 7th May and got installed the same after 5 days.
Unfortunately the temperature and sleep time can not be set , which is a major defect for an AC . Will someone kindly advise me how to use an AC without setting the temperature level ?
I don't have any option but to throw it away as the company has taken long time in accepting that the indoor unt is defective and taking proper action.",1
5408,The product seemed faulty from day1 and now it hasany cooling issues. Completely brand new AC and still not able to cool properly. The LG service is extremely poor. They are not able to send a person in 1 week to fix an issue. Only because the AC is under warranty and they have to fix it for free. Else they would have sent someone in few hours. Very bad experience with LG. I will not but any LG products going forward,1
5409,I had ordered an AC and there is heavy water leakage from the AC and Outlet as well. I gave my whole day and the installation is also done improperly and many pipes are left opened.,1
5410,"Update on 12th March: Totally pathetic installation experience, it was fulfilled by authorized LG service center with the name SAS AIR CONDITIONING. I was told that wall near balcony cannot be drilled and they put the pipes through the balcony door. The door cannot be closed now, and later we came to know that the wall can be drilled and there is no beam on it. These boys just want to complete the job and leave, and are least bothered about customer satisfaction. In the video, you can see that the other wall was completely destroyed by drilling and also there is an offset from the wall which makes it even more worse. What's more pathetic is that the boys were abusive all the time during installation and used cursing words about me on the phone, as he my ac installation was not as he expected it to be. I have raised complaint to LG customer care and yet to get a resolution.",1
5411,It give heavy light bill no use of 5 star waste of money,1
5412,"Worse experience of installation of my AC by Suhana Service. My installation request was assigned to Suhana Service and installation was supposed to be completed after 72hrs of delivery as per policy. Almost 7 days passed and didn't receive any call from technician or service provider. I lodged multiple complaints to LG and also through Amazon but didn't workout. Tried to call to Service Provider by number which I got from LG customer care many a times but no one picked or called back.

My personal experience if installation request is assigned to Suhana Service immediately call LG customer care to change request to some other service provider.

Suggestion to LG immediately blacklist Suhana Service from your account to avoid such experience.",1
5413,"Honest review after 1 month usage
1) AC is average and expensive to comparing to other 1 ton ACs
2) I don't see any AI option in remote
3) it not energy efficient
4) cooling is average
5) installation by lg is not good they charge extra then mrp
Overall I don't recommend this lg ac. It's not worth.",3
5414,"After usage of one week I am facing water leakage and no cooling, in this summer I spend around 40k and even after I am suffering from heat. The response got after registering a complaint is

5415,"AC is perfect for small size room , installation is also perfect however there is confusion where I felt cheated from Amazon on installation charges where they previously showing its added while purchasing and later brand will charge for it.
Rest AC is perfect features are also great and best thing is it's completely silent rest will see after couple of months",3
5416,"There is no plug in the package. The length of the drain pipe is around 1feet which is very less.
Remote holder also not provided within package.",3
5417,"Please note that after buying there are installation charges which cost around 4-5k.
In box 10ft copper pipe was missing which cost around 300 per feet.
You need to raise complaint for that but they will refund very less amount compared to actual cost.",3

Maine ac order Kiya tha or 20 april ko recieve hua tha uske baad installation ke liye koi nhi aarha tha itna call karne ke baad bhi koi support nhi tha kam se kam 50_60 call ki thi mai roz bolte the kal ayenge lekin nhi aate the pure 15 din baad ek Banda aaya tha installation ke liye

5419,Not able to cool small room in summer heat not able to bring temp below 30,2
5420,"Fast delivery as usual by Amazon. Product arrived in original brand package. Neat and clean handling by Amazon.

Installation service provided by LG is the worst ever. I had to raise multiple complaints via Amazon customer service for them to even schedule an installation. Installation was done on the 6th day after receiving product. LG customer care will try to mislead the customer saying that its the Amazon's responsibility to raise a request and customers can't. They did nothing until I raised a complaint through Amazon customer care. Installation is also not clean. They messed up the whole place and expect the customer to clean later.",1
5421,The product is good but the installation service is pathetic. They did not seem to be well trained and they do not bring all the required equipments. They did not bring the round drill bit for drilling the wall and hence damaged my wall. They did not had the vacuum machine and was suggesting that it is not required. They also didn't do the basic electrical setup to get my ac running. Instead they just tested my ac with a 2.5mm wire and was refusing to test it for a longer period. I had to call another electrician to power my ac. I didn't expected this kind of service from LG.,1
5422,"There is no added installation, they didn't give all the necessary items required for installation, if you want them which obviously you want should purchase again at a higher rate. Installation included is a big joke. It's only booking for installation. Like book a movie ticket at zero rupees, but if you want to see the movie pay 300 rupees plus GST and additionally you have to get your own chair or buy a stupid chair from the theater owner at a higher cost. No value for money. No quality. Poor service. Worst performance.",1
5423,"Just 1 month after purchase ac is not cooling making hell of noise and I am chasing service helpline and service center and nobody is responding, really feeling helpless. I would recommend anybody to not purchase this product. It's worst product.",1
5424,"Product arrived on time. Service guy arrived on time too. But took almost 6K in the name of installation (1415 for installation, 2000 for copper pipes, 130 rs for the plug, 650 for water pipe, 1100 for the stand, 350 for some insulation white wrap). They ended up drilling a very big hole and not filling it properly too. We had to spend time filling the area left by the service ppl. So in totality if someone is planning to buy this product go with the assumption that it will cost you almost 50K (MRP Says approx 40k.. you end up paying 6 to 7 k more) for mediocre service. Now all I am hoping is the product is not as mediocre as their service.",1
5425,"We bought 2 ac in past month
Worst installation we are depressed and un satisfied cooling also not perfect my son bought daikin it gives chill cooling. Compare to daikin lg is worst cooling performance",1

There is no leakage problem, within one year we need to fill the Gas. Very cheap quality, means ever year we need to fill the GAS.. Don't BUY.

5448,This review is not about product but about LG company . If anyone who wants to buy LG split AC don't go if you don't have back to back installation for outdoor unit. LG company made a rule that lg installation services will be not provided if they have to use ropes for installation. So because of them we have to make big hole and all ac pipes awkwardly will be shown if you have concealed pipes in your house and did interior with lakhs . They will just say sorry . Safety is important but they have to tell to customer that we do not provide service when ropes are involved. This is cheating on their part not providing this information while selling their product and installation cannot be done with others as warranty will not be valid. If they can't do then we can choose another product who can do it.,1

Now Amazon is saying due to pandemic can't help. LG service says you need to fill gas and if it has leak then you have to change condenser which will cost 8000-11000 in which i can buy a new cooler from market. Amazon says you gets 10 year warranty on purchase. LG says you have only one year comprehensive warranty.

I just bought this product and got it installed during the Amazon great Indian sale. And I can provide you and honest feedback on this product and services.
I bought this product on 11th may got delivered on 12th may and installed don 13th may, pretty impressive uhh... No... The story now begins‚Ä¶I was told about the free installation in the product from the LG...but its not‚Ä¶ when the LG technician came to my place ( Point to note) he started asking some items as part of installation
‚Ä¢ Wall mount bracket
‚Ä¢ Drain Pipe
‚Ä¢ Wall wire holder ( White Plastic thing that holds wire or small pipes on wall)
‚Ä¢ MCB switch (16 Amp) ( I had a power point separate for AC)
I said I do not have, I guess if these are part of installation they have to be inside the AC packing box or you might be carrying it. To which he said yes he is carrying but I need to pay for these as these are not part of installation (How can a wall bracket for outdoor unit not a part of installation). After sensing that I am not aware of what is required he quoted a price for me.
After he left, the AC started leaking from inside (indoor unit) from every inch. To which when I called this technician said is a temporary problem and may go by morning, If not he will come again.
When he came he said he may have to make the hole bigger he will again do some civil work, my entire room became a mess with dust and dirt after how he did. The wall are over with hand marks. He was very bad at keeping things clean and tidy.
He was not even carrying ladder which I arranged, in fact I was standing holding while the technician was working.
After the work was finished he did not even seal the Hole that he created, when I asked he said it will work, it‚Äôs not a problem, I guess I have to fill POP in that hole myself (Lot of work as again get ladder).

So in the nutshell, there is nothing called free , You have to shell out at least 2500 more from your pocket ( apart from installation) to keep everything neat and tidy.
I am keeping this a rating two for all the troubles that this product have given me, I should have bought cooler instead. I disliked the service from LG. I will recommend as the cooling is nice (but not sure as how long, it‚Äôs just two days), But make sure this is not the final amount, you may have to add at least around 2-2.5k additional.",2
5455,This AC is useless. It is unable to cool a small room inspite of keeping it running for a few hours. I even called LG customer care and had them take a look at it and the technician's advise was for me to create a separate roof over the outside unit to keep the machine a few degrees cooler. I've never heard of doing such a thing to get an ac to perform like it should. The technicians also did a shoddy job of servicing the air conditioner. Barely cleaned it and were in a hurry to leave. Terrible customer service and even poorer performance of AC. I have another inverter ac of Whirlpool and that works supremely well compared to this crap product.,1
5456,AC is good but installation service provided by LG is not good at all. Water pipe is not working water is draining inside the room. I an living in Jaipur. When call to customer care than they say to call to LG service provider near to your place who came here at the time of installation. I don't know Wht is happens with LG. I only purchased this because of service of LG but this is not expected.,3
5457,Bought it four years ago and now the condensor replacement and filling gas are needed which cost around 8000/- as AC is not getting cold. Sad that we trusted the company. Will be using this only for 3 to 4 months a year,2
5458,"Inferior quality. in last 3 months, it has stopped working twice. The service of LG is poor. The call center people say you will receive a call within two hours but this two hours never comes.
The service technician is clueless why the fan has stopped working? This is the first case. The first time he managed to fix it by JUGAD. This time I am still waiting for a response. The call center people say that I should request to send senior technician when I receive the call.
I am also having 1.5 tones another model of Dual inverter AC of LG makes installed that also make a lot of noise. The technician from authorized service center says it will make noise as it is the dual inverter AC whereas LABEL claims it is quieter than a whisper.",1
5459,Installation was a headache . Many technicians will call up but fail to show up eventually . Had to make 2-3 escalation calls before finally someone showed up for installation . The installation was also not a neat job . Cooling effects are fine .,3
5460,"I have spent 10k Rupees in the last 12 months in fixing issues which happens due to the faulty components in this AC.
The warranty only covers for the Damaged parts, and if Cooling Gas leaks due to it or something else happens as a side effect of the damaged product. The company and whoever the 3rd party company who works on their behalf would charge hefty amounts to get it fixed + 750Rs (for even just dropping by to take a look). I am frustrated by this product cz we don‚Äôt even utilize AC much often and for the amount times that we have actually used it says how bad quality and service is provided by LG.",1
5461,This AC has only given is problem. Every 5-6 months there is some problem or the other. The aluminium pipe inside is flimsy and it keeps breaking down. The swing doesn‚Äôt work sometimes doesn‚Äôt read AC temperature properly. We have spent more on it than what we had bought it for. Do NOt BuY!!!,1
5462,"In this price it is best. But all the LG Ac are not maintaining Room temperature cool after switch off. For small rooms this is better.
1st free Service is not upto market standards.",3
5463,"Bought 3 ACs - 2 1.5 ton and 1 ton. Extremely poor and unresponsive service. Literally had to call 20times and get for the product to be installed by the LG technician. When the installation people eventually came, they came merely for site verification - Upon explaining the internal layout fully for over an hour, left them with a specific instruction to install as agreed as I was travelling. However, a completely unreleased service provider was sent without any briefing and messed up the whole installation and interior design, false ceiling, etc. Escalations to the area in charge of LG also did not help who was only interested in getting his people paid and least bothered about the impact of bad installation on the brand!",1
5464,I installed this in a 10*10 room and still doesn't cool well...it takes a good 20 mins to feel and the blow area is very low to make it good.,3
5465,The experience would be better if the installation process was seamless... Had to call many times to arrange the Free installation that I got... The product is superb and powerful cooling....,3
5466,"Turned out to be a Aluminum condenser instead of a copper one. Discovered this whole unit was getting installed. Life of Aluminum condenser is questionable besides the larger problem of zero repair especially if leaks occur later. Felt cheated. Will never buy large appliances on Amazon and especially when they are discounted. Last but not the least, the product supplied had manufacturing date of April 2017 - whole one year old stock liquidated thru Amazon without declaring it was not copper but Aluminum condenser. Performance wise no complaints as yet. But trust on Amazon broken especially for large home appliances!",1
5467,"Extremey dissappointing. My room is so tiny & its not cooling at all. The room temp is just about okay. There is zero chill factor which any AC should provide. With Inverter technology i thought it would have better cooling. But it does not work.

After sales service is very poor. The installation guy charged 3885/- for installation and its supposed to be free! What a joke. He gave me a bill of 3330/-. He ruined my walls, made them extremely dirty with black marks which i cannot clean now. So my office wall is looking so bad. Extremely dissappointed with LG & Amazin for selling products .",1
5468,"This product is the worst. Please don‚Äôt buy it. It fails to cools even your 10*12 room. When we contacted the LG care, they mentioned gas leak. They repaired it, it worked for 2-3 days and we started getting the CH38 code. It‚Äôs been 1 year, 7-8 visits of LG care executives and their unfruitful repairs, and we still experience the same issue. I literally want to get rid of this product. Wish I had invested my money on a cooler instead.",1
5469,"It's outdoor Aluminium extruded fins are required to be replaced within three years of usage in Delhi air.
Which is useless..",3
5470,Cooling is pathetic. My old cooler was far better than this AC. I brought it because it was a LG product and I was having other appliances of the same company and I was very much satisfied with there performances but this AC is a total wastage of money.,1
5471,"Ac is working fine and installation is also quick.
The main problem is Installation guys, who charge you extensively. For few feet of water pipe installation and outdoor wrapping of cable was charged 1000 rupees in first floor.",2
5472,Your product is not upto mark. It was not exactly what I expect. This i am writing this review after end of 01 year of using it. It is better to go for 1.5ton capacity. 1.0 ton capacity is just to show off model only which is not efficient. Cooling take much time for room size of 10x10.....& Service is really a question mark... Very pathetic....Not going depth of problem......In 01 year they have replaced gas for 03 times.....,1
5473,"Poor Service from Amazon & the installation charged for two ACs was approx. 5000.
The Power plug was missing in the box.
The AC units delivered were an year old manufactured.",2
5474,Cooling is fast and offer on 26600 pay,3
5475,No much cooling. Struggled 3 years for it with LG. Paid 8k for AMC to fill the gas after warranty. One year after again o gas. LG asks to pay 4500 again for Gas. LG does not consider it manufacturing fault or installation mistake or lack of expertise.,1
5476,Very poor quality. AC has been throwing all sorts of errors during active operations in last 3 months. Had to contact customer service 8 times in last 2.5 months. Every time problems are unique. No replacement option. Replacement helplines are continuously engaged or people don‚Äôt pick up. Entire summer vacations ruined for children as have to be home coordinating with the service guys. Strongly urge NOT TO BUY from LG.,1
5477,It has a aluminium coil in it be careful.,3
5478,"After 1 yr have come to know the installation was done with a pipe coated with copper colored plastic .. the gas has leaked , cooling has gone and am absolutely disappointed that after paying so much , this is wt u get",1
5479,NICE,3
5480,"Split ac is very bad, poor service from lg team in noida",1
5481,"As soon as my warranty got over the cooling coil was found to have a leakage when I called the guy for regular servicing, was handed over a bill of Rs 10k. How ironic eh?",1
5482,We have puchased this a.c. its deliverary was done on 15.10 2017 and today is 21.10.2017 but no one is here for instalation...service of l.g is slow..i might return dis product coz of l.g's slow service for instalation.,1
5483,"This AC has aluminium pipe, plus it doesn't even cool the room. Please don't fall prey to this AC. All the technicians visited to install the AC told the same thing that AC is not not good.",1
5484,"Inspite of multiple requests LG didn't send a technician for installation. Finally returned the ac.Very poor LG customer service , you just keep calling different numbers and there is no response.",1
5485,"The AC was delivered with a broken water pipe.
The AC had problems 3 times in the last 3 months.
I will not recommend LG AC.
Bad product, terrible Service",1
5486,"I bought 2 lg Invertor AC. Within 8 months, AC stops cooling and issue In condenser ! Not to buy this product and also from online",1
5487,"I don't know how it works still 17 days didn't installation , after 17 days they told me you have to call lg customer care",1
5488,"Within 3 months of buying it has stopped suddenly. Pathetic. Even registered complaint for repairing, but didn‚Äôt get proper solution.",1
5489,Very bed quality not buy,1
5490,Low cooling. But it's not worth for above 26000 rupees,1
5491,Pathetic after a season,1
5492,"Not good response from LG.
Low cooling since I got this product.",1
5493,"WORST. FREE INSTALATION IS A LIE, THE GUY COMES TO YOUR HOUS AND ASKS FOR 6000 RS!",1
5494,Not recommended. To noisy and cooling is not effective.,1
5495,Bakwas,1
5496,Beware of the LG installtion team. Bad experience and the pricing got changed after installation. Rating downgraded due to installtion experience,2
5497,"Don't buy lg. I'm a voltas customer I have used lg ac before they say simple feature as they have only in thier ac dual inverter????? Every ac has two rotary piston lg calls it dual inverter if you are very high budget can afford a new ac every 6 months you can go with lg if you can afford one ac or ac which lasts long go with voltas, whirlpool etc",1
5498,Update ur energy bill please,3
5499,"LG service sucks. I bought a smart inverter ac from reliance digital the product doesn't cool well at all. It's an aluminum condensor. LG does not respond well and to top it all reliance sent me a 2017 manufacture product. Neither will LG take action to change or rectify the issue.
05-09-18 Latest update is LG days contact reliance to sort your issues we aren't responsible for the low cooling. Pathetic customer service on the part of LG",1
5500,This product of lg or every product of Lg is sooo wrost. So all people of our country you don't bought of Lg product. Lg service and product is so bad. I bought lg Ac and after one year its PCB got damaged which cost 4500.,1
5501,Purchased 4 units as we shifted to a new residence. LG installation technicians came on time but to my horror none of the units had the copper wires in them. Had to call Amazon support and they gave me an option to pay now and reimburse later. Although I agreed to this option and Amazon reimbursed me I am not sure on the quality of copper wire used. Left a bad taste in my mind for such a costly purchase. Hence rating three.,3
5502,"This dual inverter 5 star Split AC is not worth buying.
Cooling capacity is poor..Even we set in 20 degree with 100% capacity...wastage of money...in day time it is same as not having AC in the room..
Avoid buying by looing at dual inverter and 5 star features ..these are merely to save electricity by defeating the purpose of cooling by this AC...honest feedback...",3
5503,"Less power consumption,
Less noise,
Good cooling
Wi fi feature is use less, other wise you have to spend more money like new additional continues expenses.
Low air pressure.
Needs frequent filter cleaning as filter is kept horizontal at the top -not vertical or inclined, hence it requires every week cleaning.",3
5504,mujhe samjh nahi a raha hai ki 1 saal he hua is ac ko liye hue Gas kesa leak ho gayi matlb kya har Saal ac mai Gas Daalni padti hai kya? service wala alag 3000 gas ke leta hai .,2
5505,This is okish interms of cooling! Features are good but for someone ordering for top floor ! Please don't go for this !,3
5506,"The ac is not giving that much cooling ,,, it's very low wastage of money ,,",3
5507,Wifi is not connecting and abnormal sounds are irritating,3
5508,I bought this AC on March 2022. During installation itself they have extremely poor service. After 2 months AC start leaking from front & when complained they told me to switch mode instead of fixing. After 11 months when technician visited for yearly service they found Coil was leaking & need to be replaced. I have used Samsung & voltas ACs earlier & they last at least 5 years without any issues. But seems like LG makes poor products. Avoid buying any LG AC as they are of poor quality.,1
5509,Should have gone with some other brand - LG is too expensive,2
5510,"AC used wisely for 2-3 months.
Suddenly Ch 10 error displays.
After 12 days of registering complaint no proper response.
Worst customer service I experienced from LG till date.",2
5511,I ordered 1.5 ton 5 star model and it was said installation was free as it included in the unit. But technician called and told that we have to pay for installation. In top of this there will be 2 more guys accompany with the technician and we need to pay for them too. Ridiculous.. people can also rob like this.. will return this and buy in the store,1
5512,"My first ac was lg from 2006 it came for 16 years so even when everyone was saying don't go for lg I went for lg my bad.
The ac just after 5 days water is dripping from the ac, the installation was pathetic I have complainted to the lg even the tape which they used on the outdoor unit has opened up. Truly pathetic service.",1
5513,Not cooling effectively. Room size is under 140 sqft.,2
5514,"I was reading reviews and was skeptical about the negative ones cz I‚Äôve had good experience with LG before turns out they were right. LG has terrible customer service, products might be good but the customer service is just pathetic. Again don‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs so expensive and worthless. Go for carrier or DAIKIN. They have good customer service.",1
5515,"This A/C is not auto-starting AC mode on power reboot situation, which is very disappointing.
app is poor. Not all the remote features are available via app.",1
5516,Don't purchase this AC. After one month of use I am writing this review no cooling atall even cooler provide more cooling than this AC. Temperature rarely go below 30 degree. Service is also not good. They closed my service request without solution. I feel cheated. This AC is even not deserve one star.,1
5517,All d expectations r satisfactory..,2
5518,High Electricity Consumes,2
5519,Swing not working properly. Its just moving 30 degrees. It disappointed me.even LG service also not good .I have reported this issue to LG service technician they have visited but couldn't able to resolve. One of the bad experience with LG product .,1
5520,Within one year cooling is down & we are facing problem.,1
5521,AC is generally used to cool room but its to defective it‚Äôs gives Hot air. I returned it with lots of Harassment. Thanks Amazon,1

5531,Cooling of this ac is worst,1
5532,"Used ac for 10days in 180sqft room. Sharing pros and cons here
Pros
Good iot features but app doesn't include all the features that the remote has like 80% 60% modes changes.
Cooling is just about okayish, nothing great here
Cons
Outdoor unit is making noise like a helicopter is going above the house. When in sleep mode indoor unit is so quiet, u can hear outdoor unit noise in room.
If u mount ac right above ur bed it will not be useful to u because its swing blade don't go lower like other acs go. U need atleast 7/8ft distance between ur bed and ac if u can to get ac fan air on ur bed
Unit consumption is just abt 0.8 to 1 unit an hour. If u use hc cool mode it will burn 2 units or more in an hour. Sleep mode uses 0.4 unit an hour when set to 26.

If u have a bigger room with direct sunlight coming onto the rooms roof then probably this ac is not for u
Buy any heavy duty ac.
Else it's okayi for smaller rooms.",3
5533,I have thinking to buy new one..just searching good product for better satisfaction LG is reliable but after few review change my mind diverted on other one. Pl request to LG specify correct data in feature. MRP & installation charge all. MJ Rajput,2
5534,I have not bought this AC from Amazon. 1 star rating is due to the service provided by LG. LG technicians who visited were rookies and clueless about installation. Despite the fact that I showed the two previously installed ACs they could not figure out how to drill the hole for drain pipe. They drilled half hole and realized the bottom part of hole could not be drilled because of the slab. Then they left and called the core cutting guy. The core cutting guy said core cutting is done horizontally not vertically. These LG technicians didn't know how core cutting is done !? After four hours of installation which didn't happen the technicians left the whole place in dust. Even though LG might have built a good AC it is worthless due to hassles in getting it installed. Shame on LG service.,1
5535,"I buy this in Feb 2022. I have been using this from more than 3 months, It never cool the room which i set as target as 25. It continuously runs the machine but i didnt find proper cool in the room. I need to switch on my fan in order to spread the coolingness entire room. I am really not happy with this product.",1
5536,"Worst installation service. Technician is not trained, he just did the formality and shown his hunger for money. Taken 3400 and provided the bill 2170 for installation even when no extra connecting pipe/wire used. AC is running like a fun, no cooling gas in it. Chasing up with service center but no response. Don't purchase LG air conditioner. I have wasted more than 50k.",1
5537,dislike as no cooling is done. After making many complaint with LG customer care service. The senior technician not yet visited in my home and neither attend complaint nor step for replacement has been taken by the service centre. bad product.,1
5538,"With in a year it's cooler power down, don't waste your money, 7 complaints within 1 years but no solution",1
5539,The delivered product was missing a copper wire which I had to purchase separately from LG for $3800. I wrote to Amazon and the seller and did not hear back.,1
5540,"Play Video
It's a review post one month of using this product. I purchase it cause of many positive reviews on YouTube, but I really made a mistake here that I believe in what I didn't experience. This product interior is made up of plastic which makes it worst. And I get the crackling noise from the day it is installed. I complaint LG service centre, LG technician visited my place, re-assembled the AC again, waste my 4-5 hours but didn't get any solution and they did it 3 times in a month every week. You can hear the crackling(tak) sound in attached video at 0.06 & 0.16 sec, and after 1 hour of continuous running this sound repeats in every 6 seconds interval which is so irritating and annoying. So in short I'll say please don't waste your money on this product, you can get a great product from other brands in this amount. I paid 36000 in April-2024 for 2023 model without wifi. This is the biggest mistake of my life. Please do research well before buying the product online, go to the offline stores to experience the product before making your decision.",1

In free service LG team give only dry service they don't wash it, they did not use Jet pump for its cleaning, for this they take charges. Even all other big brand use Jet pump service to wash AC, They are using 10 years old type of technique for washing it.",1
5546,Consume tooo much electricity,2

Now problem with IR receiver on Indoor unit. Think twice before buying any LG product. Go for the brand with the most warranty period, atleast you won't have to spend on repair cost.

Never buy any LG AC through Amazon. I bought 2 ACs. One AC Condenser is gone defective after just 14 months. It was mentioned that there is additional 4 years warranty on condenser on the Amazon website plus the LG website as well but now additional warranty is denied because it is not mentioned in the invoice. This is plain cheating. Just for discount of few thousand rupees don't loose your peace of mind repairing these expensive products later. Better buy AC through your local dealer. Never buy any electronics online especially Amazon India. Most of the defective piece are sold online I guess.",1

They were horrible, as they were not ready to install fan wherever I was suggested instead were looking for opportunity to make money and they said installation charge will be 7-8 K. Later I have to call person from urbanclap he did at 2K .
So please don't buy these costly product in Amazon, Pefer flipkart Or anything other. Nst",2
5584,"We had multiple installation issues at the start. The installation guy installed/uninstalled it twice when complained that it‚Äôs not cooling the room. Our room is a standard small room and ideally it should feel like a refrigerator if temperature is set anything below 24. But, in our case even if we set the temperature to 17, it did not feel like it was 17. Somehow we got it fixed from external guy. Now it has been 5 years since we got the ac, the compressor is now not working. Compressor had a 10 year warranty. LG air conditioners have the best review on Amazon and outside but seems like we were the unlucky ones who got the worst one.",3
5585,"Amazon should allow separate reviews of the equipment and the installation. In my case the AC looks good and works fine, but the people sent by LG did the ugliest installation job and couldn't even understand why I didn't like it. Please see the photo. I had to pay a total of Rs 8400 for this result which has defaced the appearance of my building. What can I even say. Maybe it's better to get a private mechanic to do the installation. Once I recover from this mess, I plan to find someone reliable to re-install the unit, this will cost me another Rs 5000 at least. Please keep all this in mind when you buy an AC from Amazon.",1
5586,"AC cooling is good. I bought this since it is stabiliser free as well as having 10 year compressor warranty. Otherwise there are cheaper ones in the market than this. Installation is most pathetic. LG (lazy guys) did the installation for 4 long hours and finally it doesn‚Äôt look professional. The guy did the outdoor unit installation wrongly fixed the stand so he has to slightly bend the one of the clamp. LG should train the technicians well, these are all look like under training. Wake up Lazy Guys.",3

But the knew one is the worst not at all cooling the room even after half an hour cooling at 16 the room temp got down from 31 to 29 only. Trying to contact them but no response as it is lockdown.

5609,"Don't waste your money to buy refrigerator from Amazon. They aren't customer centric what they used to be. I purchased LG refrigerator, it was delivered by Amazon cloud tail delivery team. The couple of guys brought my shipment at 11.00 hrs when i was in midle of offical work, they just placed the item and scanned the product and politely asked the OTP no. Since I had high regards with Amazon brand and trusted them they don't deliver the items with damaged condition so i just shared the OTP with them. Those guys havent performed open delivery which they supposed to do in front of the customer. They might aware this was already damadged before it's out for delivery. Exactly afterb1 hour I just opened the boxes then I found there is a significant dent on the rear side of the refrigerator, I was so terrified and initiated thebl replacement also contacted the customer servixe, explained him about the issue. The CS guy who keep on talking about the process and refused to replacement or refund, again I spoke to his higher offical, he was also spoke about the process, doesn't understand the pain from the common man point of view. I just told him if it is a open inspection delivery, the respective delivery guys has to open the box in front of us and get it signed by the customer also the service quality team has to physically checked the shipment and ensure everything is perfect before it gets out for delivery. I am sure nothing had been happend either. I was so frustrated with the service quality from Amazon my 5 years association with Amazon has been gone for toss. They weren't reliable what they used to be. As the brand going bigger on the other hand they were slipped from the great customer experience. They might colected feedbacks and photographs, it looks like most of them who purchased this item reported silimar issues however they didn't do any alternative solution to avoid this issue. My honest feedback is don't buy it from Amazon. I just spotted the dent and dont know how is going to work.",1

5629,"After spending 25k, refrigerator is making very loud noise randomly every few hours only after 15 days of usage.
After raising complaint, LG technician came and he was not able to understand that fridge is making rattling sound every few hours. He did inspection, didn't do anything, and said noise will be gone(its my guarantee). He was not even able to understand what the problem is, even after telling him 4 times. Only 3 hours later, we heard the loud noise again and again.
Technician is not responding now and we've raised the issue again. Hoping some trained technician comes for inspection this time.

This rattling sound is like someone drilling in the wall. It's a known issue with LG fridges(you can find it on Google), but we didn't know it'll be so loud that we'll hear it in the entire flat. Totally disappointed with LG product and service. They are ruining their name by making products like this üëé

Update: After speaking to 4 technicians, sending them audio recording of noise, showing them a video from YouTube where same noise is coming from back of the fridge - they are not able to understand the issue and they are saying it's normal. Due to lockdown, they asked me to cancel the complaint and raise it again after lockdown. Let's see what they do after lockdown!

Update: After lockdown, new technician came. He said you need to adjust a coil which is behind the fridge and sound will be gone. But it's still the same. Don't know why they don't understand( or accept) that fridge has some manufacturing defect. I guess we will have to live with this sound making piece of garbage.",1

5637,"This product is always in maxi discount. When the product is not sold then only discount is given continuously. After finding maxi discount I bought it but it was a big mistake. This product has very less capacity. And the most problematic is its cooling problem. Within 10 months the product created trouble. It has no cooling. The service man came and changed the cooling control device. Even then no improvement. Then again I made second complaint. They changed the fan. But again same problem. Then again they changed the fan. Then now it is working. It took five days to get it repaired. The service man suggested to purchase the four year warranttee for the product as the parts of the product are costly. I purchased the four years warranttee for the product of Rs 7200 for 20% discount. Now my cost of the product increases to Rs 25000 plus rs 7200 . Around rs 32000. The product is not worth of this price. There are other product in which there is hardly in problem. So I advise not to buy it even if available in 50% discount. Moreover, I think service man intentionally created trouble in maintenance and reflected as if the problem may occure in future, so that I buy the warranty for four years. It was a trap.

Despite following all the installation instructions and ensuring a proper power supply, the appliance is entirely non-functional. It is evident that the refrigerator is defective and, unfortunately, has failed to serve its intended purpose.

My primary reason for purchasing this fridge was to ensure the hassle-free preservation of groceries, especially perishables such as fruits, vegetables, and ice creams. The unexpected breakdown of the fridge has not only caused immense frustration but also led to the wastage of my groceries. In total, I estimate the cost of the wasted items to be around 2000 rupees, which is a significant hole in my pocket.

The service support guy called and challenged saying that no fibre parts are covered under warranty it is written under the terms and conditions it seems. It felt like he was trained by the LG to say this because LG knows that they have used substandard product

He even had the audacity to challenge me to write in Amazon or Flipkart or in evening Twitter accounts he knows that the company has told him to do this.

Because we are in India where these companies can do whatever they want if they are write anything in terms and conditions

Didn‚Äôt raised exchange request afterwards once I was home because I didn‚Äôt want to go through the return process and wait another week or more.",1
5839,"LG 272 L 3 star ref , First I couldn't take clear photo of the scratches because the material is transparent .....LG 272 is good , delivery was good , they told me to check for any damages and didn't ask for OTP until I am fully satisfied which was great right ?.. but seeing few scratches here and there , I thought it would go after cleaning and I didn't want to be rude and return the product for few scratches , which I thought I would do , before their arrival , but at that point , I just said ""its ok"" and gave them the OTP .The scratches didn't go after cleaning and I can feel mild dent when I touch but since it is in the door I don't mind for now but need to check with LG team tomorrow (lol and cry)... They informed me lg installation team will come to home , and yes they called me , they will come tomorrow . I will give 4 STAR for the fridge , I started using it had a talk to the lg team when they called , before turning ON , It cools slowly at start after 3 hours its fine , freezer cools quickly though and really less noise compared to my old refrigerator's I used , so that's really good ... but will definitely not recommend buying online , just go to a shop or if you can just return it do it , but it will be a tough call if your too shy like me .. This was my mistake .. I will give 3 STAR for amazon because at least I had an option to return , but amazon should take little more effort because these scratches or not new , it looks very old so you would have seen it before sending it to me ...Now a days it hurt's a lot when making bad decisions or get cheated (just cry no lol), that's why writing review's.. hope it helps some one ...",3

5852,"The cooling system of the fridge has a manufacturing defect, which the service guys (nearly 6 people have come so far) from LG have not been able to identify even after looking into the fridge 8 times over the past three years. Also the rubber tubing is so poor in quality that it has developed holes leading to fungus formation over it during rains despite regular cleaning of fridge.
They know only one way to repair the fridge which is to fill the coolant gas and have charged 3000 rs till now just to fill and refill the gas over a two year period.
5 months since the purchase of the fridge frost formation was seen in the freezer (this fridge is supposedly frost free). The repair guy says no issue with the fridge as the fridge continues to work WTH.
6 months later the fridge stopped working and they filled the coolant gas. The fridge started making noise 5 mins once and frost formation was found near compressor tube. The service guy did gas refills 4 times, frosting stopped but noise did not. He suggested a change of compressor and the compressor was changed. Yet the noise never stopped and the complaint was closed
After a year and half from the change of compressor the fridge stopped working completely. It took us 10 calls to the customer service and an escalation mail to get the service guy to declare that he would have to take the fridge to workshop to do an autopsy of that dead crap and identify where the fault lies. We waited for 10 days for the senior engineer (the only guy who knows atleast something about the fridge) to look into it and we have been asked to wait for 4 days just for the pick up of the fridge.
If this is not HARASSMENT THEN what Is? NO MORE LG.
BEWARE BUYERS.
Wtr to the rubber tube the service guy told us lies that he had ordered a new tube, without placing any such order and charged us money in advance, closed the complaint and repeated the lie when asked after a month. Look at the audacity.
also we had to throw a washing machine from LG within 5 years of its purchase.
If this is the kind of service provided in a metro like Chennai. Just imagine how these guys will cater to other remote locations.",1

LG is claiming that they are escalating internally but no call from LG installation technician. Have called Amazon but Amazon support gave few numbers to reach out to LG but the response from LG is same. This is my first unsatisfactory experience purchasing something from Amazon, hope Amazon takes a note of this.",3
5863,"Delivery of the machine was perfect but installation was very careless. The installation mechanic (named Sridhar) was not paying attention to his job as he was always busy on mobile. He did not give the installation report nor the key to the fridge. He left a lots of plastic, paper and thermocol pieces littered all over the house and just walked away without a word. He did not even handover the stamped warranty card. I have never seen such a callous workman employed by an MNC. He should be summarily dismissed from the services.

I wanted a fridge with convertible freezer (LG GL-T292RASN, Amber Steel).
This product (GL-I292RPZL, Shiny Steel) is wrongly placed along with the convertible fridge at the same webpage of Amazon MISLEADING ME INTO BUYING THIS believing that both have the same technical specifications.
The discrepancy was identified only when engineer came to install it and he told that this fridge is not convertible.
When I called Amazon to report about it. Initially their representative insisted that both the models had same technical specifications. That is, it took me time to make him understand that both the products were different in technical specifications, and one model was CONVERTIBLE, while the other one was NOT CONVERTIBLE.
After keeping me on hold for a few minutes, he started blaming me instead that I should have verified the technical details myself before placing order.
And that now they would not entertain my request to return / replace my request to rectify the discrepancy . I have tried to click return on the product under my orders, but nothing seems to be happening.
I don't know what to do now in order to get the right product that I need (LG GL-T292RASN, Amber Steel) instead of (GL-I292RPZL, Shiny Steel) which I was mislead into ordering believing that it was of the same technical specs as the former, as both are on the same webpage of amazon.",1

But... I got a damaged piece (see pictures). Luckily I saw it, else would have passed off.

I have bought everything from Whey protein to Televisions from Cloudtail. Never had this experience. They promptly took it back but no replacement - only refund.

Giving 3 stars because the product by itself was good and because Amazon made the refund super smooth",3
5870,"Product is great but delivery guys brought fridge in a open omni van in a lying down position instead of standing up.
Compressor is filled with oil which is critical to its operation. In the normal upright position gravity keeps the oil in the compressor. When we lay the refrigerator flat, some of the oil can leave the compressor and go into the cooling lines. The oil is a thick viscous fluid and can clog the cooling lines thus hampering the refrigerator's ability to cool. Lack of oil in the compressor can also damage the compressor.

A fridge should not place like a coffin box, causes blockage in compressor. Its a very bad experience and never seen in my lifetime like that. 3 days after lg people came for demo, they did a good job.",2

The LG technician did a horrible job on installation as well. I want to return the product and tried to reach out to Amazon. Amazon sent their technician and these Amazon technicians who are not at all trained for the job have provided evaluation that the issue is resolved. This technician who visited didn‚Äôt knw where the temperature control knob is placed inside the refrigerator. He also didn‚Äôt know the difference between dual converter fridge and a compressor inveter fridge. However the issue is not yet resolved. Such a waste of money buying electronic item on Amazon.

Delivery was OK. Found little scratch by side but could not return as I bought for exchange.
1/3 portion is reserved for freezer hence space for fridge is reduced. In side egg tray is for 6 eggs and you can not keep more than 6 eggs due to rack partition. In my earlier fridge there was no partition hence there was more space. Performance is ok so far.",3

And the technician said there is gas choke. And it costs Rs.2200. After calling to customer care they said it is 1593. And most important thing is after repair, if there is any problem occurs, they do free service up to 90 days only. After 90 days, if the problem occurs again, I may need to pay another 1593. For how long like this? This is the worst policy on the part of LG.
Go for other brand which gives at least 3 year general warranty.
After 90 days (on7.5.2022), it got one more repair and I paid Rs1903.

Then started the issues. Within 10 days the cooling of the refrigerator stopped. A service engineer visited and concluded that there is a Gas Leakage !!!

Such a potentially dangerous fault in one of the best selling product ??? That too in just 10 - 15 days ??

I asked for the replacement from LG and LG directed me to talk with their Authorised Service Center. Their replies where beyond pathetic.

Mr. Sandeep from Gurgaon service told that their might have been some fault with LG Transportation. When pushed for a replacement he plainly suggested there could be a problem with new one too and what will I do then ?

Such brilliant people make up the service and sale of LG. Please be mindful while making this purchase. Atleast in my case my wife suggested this product so I blamed her, you might not be as lucky ‚òπÔ∏è",1

I contacted LG few times regarding the missing rear panel (see attached image) and I still haven't had a response.
I have heard that the missing real panel is in fact the way it is designed. Having said that, I'd still expect a response from LG. It is worrying to think how LG will respond to a more serious problem at some point in the future.

5998,"We have bought this product in August 2021.
From the start, there was a water leakage. After confirming, that its a persistent leakage, we registered a complaint in just one month, September 2021. The Engineer visited, diagnosed the problem to faulty condenser. There was a followup visit where he tried to replace the original condenser with another design meant for another model. He couldn't explain why the condenser of different design with poor fitment is replaced in place of same model. However, he acknowledged that the product design seems faulty.
There were several visits by service engineers after that, where once there was cooling issue where gas was refilled then another time the fridge body was getting overheated, so again several pipes were cut and issue was resolved. The product kept troubling us and then in May 2022, it entirely stopped cooling. The complaint was raised and this time the fault was with compressor, which was replaced. Again several pipes were cut.
Now we have a one year old fridge which has been repaired several times with several pipe cuts by service engineers, both the primary parts(compressor and condensor) replaced. Additionally the condenser belongs to another model and can't even fit properly in this model.
This clearly shows a faulty product delivered to us.
The fridge is troubling us again for past one month.
I am not able to understand, who is at fault?
Is it the LG design team, which produced an incompatible product so condenser replacement with a different model was needed. Or is it the quality team that let an inferior product pass through which needed multiple repairs and replacements in the first year itself. Or is it the service team, who visited us many many times, leaving a fridge with several pipe joints and both main parts replaced.

I have again raised this request for LG's attention.
Will update the review, if there is any change.",1

6000,"I have been using this fridge for about a month and I am not happy with it.

Pros: Reasonably spacious, decent space organization, got it at a big discount

Cons:

1) The build quality is very poor - the plastics, the body - all are very flimsy and low quality. There is no weight to the door and additionally just before being fully shut, there is a weird resistance which causes the door to remain unclosed often, if not carefully fully closed by pushing the door fully shut. No refrigerator that I have had till now had this problem. The plastic used in the trays and compartments is very flimsy. There is no sturdiness to them and they feel cheap.

2) There is a problem of excessive moisture being developed in the fridge even after making sure no vent is being blocked by items inside, having adequate space between the fridge and the wall on all its sides, and setting the temperature of the two sections (the main compartment and the freezer) as instructed. This is causing food items to have a foul smell of the fridge (damp and unpleasant smell) - which is totally unacceptable and highly disappointing from a brand-new fridge from such a reputed brand. Even after being disappointed by the bad build quality, I was hoping that at least the electronic part of the fridge would be good because that is the most important part but unfortunately even that has this problem.

I always use LG products and my experience so far before this fridge was spotless and excellent. All their products that I have used over the years were wonderful. This refrigerator is a big exception and a disappointment. I regret buying an LG fridge and wish that I would have bought a Samsung. My 9 year old Samsung fridge is still working much better. However, I understand that it was a matter of luck that I bought this particularly bad model. I am sure that LG - being the fantastic company that it is - makes good refrigerators and this is just an exception and a bad model. I would not recommend this model at all.",2

This fridge was bought in May 2021. Within a year a little ice started forming in the freezer section. But that gradually increased. To my misfortune when I finally called the LG customer care it was just over a year. I was told that the warranty was for only a year on the fridge and 10 years on the compressor. After registering a complaint I had to follow up with the mechanics for 2 weeks before someone turned up. I was charged Rs 750, for the mechanic to tell me that the rubber lining could be faulty. He turned it around and left. The problem still continues and no one has yet come to attend to the fridge.

6087,"I'm a loyal LG customer but this one choice has me completely confused and frustrated, it was like the fridge was designed by someone who never uses one.

They look a lovely refrigerator, made is quieter - extra points for that, took away all color options and stuck to a bland silver, and here's the double whammy - they removed all the slots for putting the shelves!

If you want to change the spacing - which is pathetic by the way - large spaces at the bottom which cannot be divided at all, there's no way of working around it other than using some stackable boxes. No flexibility at all.

Secondly, unfortunately we didn't realise this when we went to buy the fridge (bought it elsewhere, so it was really bad inspection on our part but we never had these issues before so didn't know better) - the door does NOT close automatically! This apparently is a very 'smart' feature now applicable in all new LG refrigerators. If you gently close the fridge door, it will stall at half closed, and not close automatically.

Thirdly, they take your health very seriously. Taking out the vegetable tray will mean literally bending all the way to the floor - the opening handle is at the very bottom! Genius design, as I mentioned. Another thing we didn't really note when we bought this. My mistake that I had a preference for LG. It is very quiet though, which is important to me.

Fourth, if you want to readjust the fridge temperature, you will have to press the buttons by shoving your head into the fridge as it is at the back. New designs like Samsung have this on the door.

So think twice. The advantages here are the silent functioning and if you want it, the enormously large third shelf, but there are so many cons in the whole series by LG right now, you might want to consider another brand.",3
6088,They stopped their invertor compressor production before our 10 year compressor warranty. After that they will not able to repair the refrigerator.

Within 3 years, the cooling stopped and it was as good as a cupboard.

Now the reason we all buy big brands like LG and samsung is not just quality but also the fact that they have the best after sales service. And up until now, this is what i thought as well.

Its been 7 days since since my fridge stopped working and I've been calling them every single day for repair service and everyday they tell the same thing..""sir, you will get a call from technician today""

We found it next day when we started loading the fridge. When called the local LG support here, they said they'll look into it. I don't think they're efficient. Technician asked us to pay 11k for extra warranty which is ridiculous. Though we didn't fall for his tricks, they need to stop looting customers. Overall, not very happy with LG. Will definitely not recommend this one or for that matter any LG appliances.",3

I have undergone six service engineer visits within 1st 3 months of the purchase, with each visit consuming an agonizing 4-5 hours of my time. During these visits, various components of the refrigerator were replaced multiple times, which suggests that the root cause of the problem remains elusive. This situation is wholly unacceptable, and I find it extremely distressing that a renowned brand like LG is unable to provide a satisfactory resolution to a problem that has persisted for so long. Even today, it consistently malfunctions every 10 days, leading to food spoilage and necessitating repetitive part replacements‚Äîall without resolving the recurring issue. This ongoing ordeal has severely disrupted my routine, undermined my faith in LG's reliability, and resulted in substantial inconvenience.

He left without attending to the complain and asked me not to raise complaint again as he would return in 3-4 days time with the tools (as the tools were to be received from out of station).
That guy never returned but a new problem also started. This time there was condensation in the fridge side of the refrigerator and the complete section was dripping with water. All of my vegetables and fruits got spoiled.
I called up customer care who told me that the complaint of door not getting closed has already been closed by them. So as per them I am not having any issues now. For further assistance, I was asked to call a mobile no of CCO (Manager) 9988077785 who would take care of my problem. Despite of my calling this number umpteenth times no one picked the call.

In 2019, I bought a refrigerator from Khosla for 54,000/-, it had a 10-year compressor warranty. Worse on 2nd Oct 2023, LG mechanic checked and said it will be changed. After 4-5 days another mechanic came and told condenser and bad change for 4000/-. He said that without applying the compressor. Various excuses have been going on for about 15 days. Those who buy will suffer later.",1

6238,Very good product,3
6239,"I bought and used this product for more than 15 days and I think I am eligible to give you an honest review.

Like many of us, I bought this when I saw a good price drop. There was a discount of around 2000 from the usual price and I paid around 14.5k for the refrigerator. Which looked like a really good buy, initially.

As the days went by. I realised that the cooling of the fridge was not upto the marks. Morover, both the sides of the fridge were making noise when touched. It felt like the fridge was taking earthing from the touch. I filed for replacement and was contacted by the amazon technicial who suggested that it is normal for compressor to make noises. I didn't mind the earthing problem too much. Because I thought it is a minor issue and won't bug me much.

However after few days, the corners of the fridge starting giving literal electric shows ( the image of which is provided above ). I contacted the amazon for replacement and they said they can't replace the product as they don't have the product available with them. They are clearly lying because it was available in stocks after after the call was disconnected and it is still in stock. The catch is it is available at higher price now

They said they can only make refund which means I will get my 14.5k back and I will have to pay around 2k more for the fridge, now. I bought this fridge only because it was available at cheaper price and I have even sold my old working fridge also. I have no option but to buy the fridge at higher price.

I guinenely felt that they gave discount on the unsold defective piece and tried to clear their stock by fooling their customer. It is disappointing and tiresome process. Please beware if you are buying the fridge for cheap price you might end up getting a defective piece and have to waste your precious time in refund/replacement/techinician visits etc.",1

My experience with the LG 343 L 3 Star Frost-Free Smart Inverter Double Door Refrigerator (2023 Model, GL-S382SPZX) has been an absolute disaster, primarily due to the recurring issue of cooling coil leakage and LG's abysmal service.

Shortly after purchasing this refrigerator, I noticed water pooling beneath it. Upon investigation, it became apparent that the cooling coils were leaking. This led to a constant puddle of water on my kitchen floor, which not only damaged the flooring but also posed a safety hazard.

I contacted LG customer service immediately, hoping for a swift resolution. Unfortunately, my interactions with their service department were frustrating beyond belief. It took them multiple visits to even diagnose the problem correctly. Each time a technician came, they seemed clueless and ill-prepared, often needing to order parts that took weeks to arrive.

To make matters worse, the repairs were never permanent. Despite their assurances, the leakage issue persisted, causing ongoing inconvenience and stress. The refrigerator's performance suffered as a result, with inconsistent cooling and frequent temperature fluctuations, rendering it unreliable for storing perishable items safely.

The ""Express Freeze"" feature, touted as a highlight of this model, was a joke. It failed to function effectively due to the underlying cooling coil problem, leaving me with no confidence in the refrigerator's advertised capabilities.

LG's customer service was equally disappointing. Their representatives were unhelpful, offering vague promises and excuses instead of concrete solutions. I felt like I was constantly chasing them for updates and resolution, wasting hours on the phone and waiting endlessly for callbacks that never came.

In conclusion, the LG GL-S382SPZX refrigerator has been a colossal waste of money and a source of endless frustration. The recurring cooling coil leakage, coupled with LG's incompetent service, has made me regret ever choosing this brand. Save yourself the headache and avoid this model at all costs.",1

Model number : GL-T402JDS3/2021
360 LTR. Writing a review after almost 3 years. What prompted the review was the the amount that I am having to spent almost on a yearly basis to keep the Refrigerator ALIVE and WORKING.
2. The Refrigerator often stopped working and it's Fan had to be replaced twice. Gas leakage were common and the same had to be done thrice in these 3 years.
3. Last 10 days the lower half of Refrigerator is not working. The authorized service centre technician is advising replacement part which costs almost Rs 5000.
4. It's exterior paint on the door also peeled off and gives shabby appearance.

Saddly, In my refrigerator I found these adhesive sticker/tapes all over the refrigerator. Feels kinda cheap . ( Like a buying a lower model car & having just spaces in place of actual functioning buttons ) . Really didn't expected that from Amazon .

But let me tell the if you are planning to buy, Please do not buy from Amazon. The support is pathetic or has become pathetic. I always vouch for Online as you have cheaper and more options, but better pay a little extra but buy from retail.
I ordered this refrigerator, received a manufacturing defect one. While purchasing they show 10 days replacement only but later on they will say only return is possible. They will assign Delhivery to pick up the return and Delhivery will make your life hell, will not come for pick up and will not pick up calls. Amazon will keep rescheduling pick up again and again and this will go on, I approached consumer ministry helpline then only they picked up the product.

Ordered again, thinking may be a one time experience, forgive and move. They delivered the same defective product. We refused to accept using open box inspection option but now they have not refunded my money. Honestly, I have called them over 20 times and each time a different executive says a different thing.
My money is being stucked. Amazon will waste your precious time and energy. Do not Buy from Amazon.
Amazon is excellent for small items but do not buy large or costly appliances or items from Amazon, you will regret it.
If you are lucky, will get good product but in case of any issue get ready to call Amazon 10 times a day everyday.
I even mailed India head Amit, he or his team saw my email and a guy named Adam followed up, it was just a formality. He never meant to help, just a call and sympathy. No solution, never responds to email, just emails asking for feedback.
Go For Retail, Do not buy from Amazon. You can try filpkart but again might throw same case.
Inshort, Avoid Amazon, they are pathetic. If India head is not helping you, how call center executives will help.",1

The refrigerator works fine for the initial days (for me it was 11 months), but after that it's just a nightmare.
It's been a year and the refrigerator hasn't worked for total of 60 days.
Evey two or three weeks the refrigerator shows some problem, and stops working, and it is non functional for a months and after several follow up (and several means 2-3 calls per days for atleast 2-3 weeks) with LG team, the refrigerator works of another max of 2-3 weeks (in most of the cases it will stop working in the first week only)

Now it has stopped working for five days, and LG is saying it will take a week to get the replacement component.

They say the compressor has to be shipped from another place & there are many more customers waiting for the same. The fridge failed in the midst of a summer peak & we are left without a redress for the past 10 days! Dont ever trust LG.,1
6372,"This model is probably no longer supported by LG, a freezer part broke down exactly 1 year after buying the fridge 5 days after the warranty expired, So team LG have accurately guessed the warranty as 1 year. Just imagine ‚Çπ40K for something that is guaranteed to last only 1 year. Secondly the service guy placed the order for the part first locally, then as it was not available, order was placed in Bengaluru, there too it's unavailable so now order is placed in Noida, so 5 days now and I do not have a refrigerator.
So please check with the local LG dealer only which fridge has better support. And support is needed as today's electronics are delicate and stupid because they are made with tolerances for failure (servicing business) unlike the old days where quality was the most important.",1

Writing this review after 6 months of struggle with LG product. Strongly recommend to not buy LG refrigerator. From day-1 itself, the refrigerator is making loud noise when the compressor picks up. It sounds like my AC. This sound can be heard in the entire house. So I'm not able to use this refrigerator. I raised multiple compliants, but LG ASM said it is normal and they can't do anything about it. So, better stay away from LG refrigerator. After 4 months, there was another fault in the grill circuit and LG technician said to replace the entire grill unit. The video of the fault is attached for ref. Even after CEO escalation, there is no resolution to the problem and the refrigerator is lying idle in my house for last 6 months now. Worst experience I had with LG.",1

6425,"Hello Folks,
I ordered and paid money during the festive sale, got an exchange offer at 7K for my old fridge and a 1.5K discount for a credit card, our family was so happy. Our old single door refrigerator is working, no scratches, superb cooling, so we thought exchange won't have any problem.

On the scheduled date, the Amazon delivery associates came to pick up the old fridge, they barely looked for inspecting any changes but found our bottom corner fridge has rust on it, ourselves itself dint notice it before. We said to those guys since we live near seashore and corrosion happens naturally since it's been 5 years, after that, they talked to us very rudely and refused to take our fridge. Told us to look at the whole thing and properly inspect if there is actually any physical damage like holes or dents. If rusting is your problem, give a good price of exchange-value instead of 7K.

Those guys never listened to us and told they won't pick, hence the product will get returned, the money will be refunded. We were left helpless, I called Amazon customer care multiple times explained the situation they were also not ready to help at all, saying it's not possible once DA guys rejected.

I was like if our fridge was damaged or not working or corroded visibly where it hampers looks I would have agreed, rusting at bottom of the thin layer where it can be fixed by cleaning can solve the issue. They strictly said NO. Are they expecting a new fridge nothing to happen for an old product? Common guys are sensible, if there is any damage you exchange the price accordingly, else don't offer and disappoint customers.

Anyway, people, I don't want any of them to suffer like me, so please beware if you are buying any big products or exchanging in the so-called multibillion-dollar e-commerce sites.",1
6426,Worst product.... stopped working within 8 months of purchase,1
6427,"In summation I did not get my dream fridge even after ordering it ""twice""!!___Ya! TWICE!!... And they used my money to make profit without giving me back anything in return... here's how they did it.

Orders 2nd : This is the second time I ordered the same fridge in Great Indian Sale of Amazon (What happened to the first order is written below, that's an interesting read too.).

So this shopping festival began on 03 October 2021, but for Prime members it started on 02 October 2021 i.e. one day before. It offered discount on price from Rs. 38990 to Rs. 35990. So great. There was a 10% discount on HDFC bank cards (yes with an asterisk mark.. don't get fooled, it is maximum 1000 rupees for debit card and 2000 rupees for credit card.. that's it).

On 02 October I tried placing the order and wow! I was offered a cashback of almost Rs. 1500 plus I was gonna use my amazon pay balance etc. So it was coming quite decent. In excitement I made the payment. Yay! I was getting my dream fridge after all...

But no... the payment declined... why?... not because I had no balance in my account, but because there was ""Some technical problem"" from HDFC bank's side. And I was asked to check the next day. Next day came and again I placed the order.... but now the cashback was only 500 rupees and not 1500 rupees. Still I went ahead thinking I was getting a deal better than from a shop anyway. I placed my purchase.

Surprisingly the order came withing 4 to 5 days unlike earlier 10 days delay. So I was very excited. It was very nice to find some lucky marks on the packing box - many dents and a good piercing through the box. I waited for the brand installation guys to unpack it. When they unpacked it, the side of the machine bore a good conspicuous dent. It broke my heart. I was not going to accept any fresh thing that is already damaged. I called up the customer service, which asked for photos etc. And told be that, there is only refund and no replacement. Do you know what that means?

It means you were attracted by Amazon by a bait of discount + cashback + card discount etc. Then made you purchase a large object Costing thousands of rupees, kept your money for 10 days, rolled it around, made profit, then gave you faulty object, apologised for the inconvenience, offered you the refund, but declined to give you the object again at the same price. Thus if you want the fridge, you can book it again at a higher price either from market or amazon. Amazon has thugged you already.

Order 1st: I had made the same order before a few days at rupees 38990 but it wasn't delivered at all. When I first spotted the right fridge LG 335L Dazzle Steel the price was 38450 and then next day it was 38990 when I booked it but after a few day it again became 38450. Wow that was frustrating. But you know when you are a middle class someone you compromise on many levels because you want that dream object. So I still bought it. The update said it would delivered 7 days later. The status showed that the fridge was shipped etc. But on 6th day I got a service call apologising for further delay by 2 days. That's 9 days in total. I thought ok. But it didn't show up even on 10th day. So called the customer service to check what happened to my beloved fridge. They said it was still in a storage facility in ""Rajasthan"", and I live in Maharashtra. I was so frustrated that I cancelled it.

Amazon parked my money amounting to more than 35k for around 20 days. They made profits through their Amazon Pay fund management wing, and gave me nothing but frustration.",1

The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.",1

6573,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.",1
6574,"I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand . Or you can wait it out for LG UT80 series as they are significantly better having tested it myself in an offline store .",3

Today I bought my lg tv from Amazon. I happy with this. But the thing is delivery boy demanding me to give tip of 200 rupees. I have given 150 rupees. I feel very bad for this.",3
6583,Play Video,3
6584,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.",2

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

6592,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG.

Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Display - 5/5
Sound quality - 4/5
Sound loudness - 1/5
Overall - 2.5/5",2

I have been calling to Amazon for installation, they are providing two contact numbers for LG service center, but these numbers are not working and amazon people also raised complaint more than 6 times till now, however I didnt get any resolution till now and atleast i have n‚Äôt received contact details for any service person till now. I have been wasting my time for 2-4 hours for calling amazon and finding LG service center contact details. Finally Indecided and I urged Amazon to take their product and give my refund but they are refusing even for this. This is the worst experience I ever faced from amazon and even from such great brand LG.",1
6617,"During installation by LG technician the TV did not come On for a long time. The Power On LED sometimes blinked. Then by chance it came on, and it worked.

6618,"All the TVs being sold by the seller named Dawntech have issues with quality check, prefer buying one from a physical store nearby.

Just got 1 year warranty. Also even after doing many changes in colour setting display is not that good. My Benq monitor has much better display and color in default settings. Really disappointed to purchase this TV. Should have gone for Sony 43 inch instead.
Even for installation I had to call 3-4 times. I will sell TV for sure in near future.",1
6623,"Right now I am trying to return the unit without any sort of replacement.
On the unit: the remote was very slow to operate, two of the programs showed weird design patterns after 4-5 minutes of viewing. The installer walked away without explaining the remote (which is really complicated with myriads of buttons). Whenever a wrong button was pressed, I was asked a lot of questions which I could not understand and the TV went into a mode from which only power off was a recovery. The installer refused to return/explain and asked me to complain to LG - worst insult ever.",1

However I ordered it with exchange and it was not a good experience. First they agreed to take the old TV and then installed the new tv. Post that they threatened me that if I don't pay up they will take away the new tv. They strong armed me into cash payment. Avoid exchange on Amazon.",1

6642,"I recently purchased an LG 65-inch TV via Amazon, excited to upgrade my home entertainment experience. Unfortunately, what arrived was a faulty unit, with the panel flickering incessantly.

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.",1

And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.
I noticed it and quickly raised a complaint.

Surprisingly I spoke with the customer care guys and found out that a request for panel replacement has been raised. I was looking for a piece to piece replacement as it's been hardly 1.5 month and the product it self is defective. Frankly I would say I received a defective product.",1

The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.",1

The technician had told that the video port had burned off due to a voltage surge from the set top box. He had showed the burned portion also. As per the warranty I understand that LG doesn't cover issues due to voltage surges. But then, I have been using televisions of other brands like Sony & Panasonic for long and no such issues had occurred while using the same set top box. But just after buying an LG TV, if it burns off then I have to wonder about the quality of the circuit board used by LG. It is possible that the issue occurred due to a faulty board and not a voltage surge. It is unfortunate LG doesn't cover such issues even during the warranty period even though it's only a 2 week old product. It has been a disappointing experience for me with LG and would not ever be buying or recommending an LG product again.",1

6873,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.",1
6874,"I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand . Or you can wait it out for LG UT80 series as they are significantly better having tested it myself in an offline store .",3

6882,"Hello,
Today I bought my lg tv from Amazon. I happy with this. But the thing is delivery boy demanding me to give tip of 200 rupees. I have given 150 rupees. I feel very bad for this.",3
6883,Play Video,3
6884,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.",2

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

6892,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

AI sound mode makes it worse.
I regret buying this because of the sound.",3

We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.",3

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

This is a scam which is being run as a post service. I will add the same post on twitter.",1

Pros:
1.budget 4k TV at affordable price

3.decent sound output
4.movable TV wall mount for adjusting the viewing angle
5.IPS panel with good blacks and colour optimisation by the processor
6.Excellent service response and installation by LG

Cons:
1.Build quality not upto the mark.. panel gaps between PANEL and bezels are evident
2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating

6915,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.",1

And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.
I noticed it and quickly raised a complaint.

Surprisingly I spoke with the customer care guys and found out that a request for panel replacement has been raised. I was looking for a piece to piece replacement as it's been hardly 1.5 month and the product it self is defective. Frankly I would say I received a defective product.",1
6973,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.",1
6974,"I got a 55 inch TV thinking I will recieve an IPS panel, but alas I got a VA panel .. and even with a VA panel, the BLACKS aren't that good . The upscaling works very avg , the SD channel aren't even worth watching.
Connectivity is good with wifi has ample ports
The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand .

6983,Play Video,3
6984,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.",2

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

6992,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

This one is just the opposite. The soundstage is not clean. The audio has too much of distortion. The mids are not clean. Too much overpowering lows creating distortion for the highs.
Bluetooth is patchy: signal intermittently drops even within 10m LoS range.
AI sound mode makes it worse.
I regret buying this because of the sound.",3
7002,"I'll start with the good parts. Panel is bright, picture quality is great(clear), audio is perfect for us. We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.",3

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

Cons:
1.Build quality not upto the mark.. panel gaps between PANEL and bezels are evident
2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating

7015,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.",1

And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.

7073,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.",1

The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand .

Today I bought my lg tv from Amazon. I happy with this. But the thing is delivery boy demanding me to give tip of 200 rupees. I have given 150 rupees. I feel very bad for this.",3
7083,,3
7084,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.",2

7091,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.",3
7092,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Anyway i prepare Flipkart only for all the major purchases like mobile, laptops so many things but very first time went to amazon but very bad experience",3

This one is just the opposite. The soundstage is not clean. The audio has too much of distortion. The mids are not clean. Too much overpowering lows creating distortion for the highs.
Bluetooth is patchy: signal intermittently drops even within 10m LoS range.
AI sound mode makes it worse.
I regret buying this because of the sound.",3
7102,"I'll start with the good parts. Panel is bright, picture quality is great(clear), audio is perfect for us. We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.",3

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

Cons:
1.Build quality not upto the mark.. panel gaps between PANEL and bezels are evident
2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating

7115,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Upon contacting LG's installation team, they confirmed the TV was indeed faulty. However, the ordeal didn't end there. When reaching out to Amazon's customer care for assistance, I was informed that they didn't offer exchanges for the TV but would provide a refund.

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

Overall, this experience has left me deeply disappointed and has shattered my trust in Amazon's ability to handle such situations effectively. It's disheartening to encounter such poor customer service, especially when dealing with a significant purchase like a TV.",1

And also the edges of the tv are not rigid when I press the panel keeps moving inside as if the tv edges are improperly fixed.
I noticed it and quickly raised a complaint.

Surprisingly I spoke with the customer care guys and found out that a request for panel replacement has been raised. I was looking for a piece to piece replacement as it's been hardly 1.5 month and the product it self is defective. Frankly I would say I received a defective product.",1
7173,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.",1

The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand .

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.",2

7191,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.",3
7192,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Anyway i prepare Flipkart only for all the major purchases like mobile, laptops so many things but very first time went to amazon but very bad experience",3

This one is just the opposite. The soundstage is not clean. The audio has too much of distortion. The mids are not clean. Too much overpowering lows creating distortion for the highs.
Bluetooth is patchy: signal intermittently drops even within 10m LoS range.
AI sound mode makes it worse.
I regret buying this because of the sound.",3
7202,"I'll start with the good parts. Panel is bright, picture quality is great(clear), audio is perfect for us. We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.",3

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

Cons:

7215,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

7273,"For those who are reading this.. this not entirely a product review. Let me guide you through the entire process of my agony.
I ordered this item on 8/10/23 and it cost me 23,262.05/- (after offers on no cost EMI). The item was delivered on 13/10/2023. The delivery was prompt and they informed us that technician from LG will call us for installation. Since no one called, so I called back to LG from the contact info provided in Amazon app and booked an installation request on 14/10/2023. The personnel from LG came on 15/10/2023 and when he checked the item (by simply connecting it to power), it was found to be defective because the screen was not switching ON. I tried to return/replace the item on 15/10/23 itself. But only available option was to book a technician. So, I booked a technician (for 17/10/2023, because that was the nearest date available) and I also called customer care to request replacement and they advised me to wait for technician to check. Technician completed the service by evening of 17th (after again reminding through customer care). After 48 hours (which is the standard waiting period for some reason!!!) there was no response from Amazon regarding return/replace. So, I contacted customer care on 19/10/2023. The customer agent concurred that the technician also agrees that the item is defective and said that only return was possible for that item and that he has initiated the return and that within 48 hours someone will come for pick up. But nothing of the sort was updated in the App. I again waited for 48 hours but no one called or came. Then I again contacted customer care on 21/10/2023, and the agent told me that no return has been initiated. At this point I was fed up. They have blatantly lied to a customer on a recorded call. Then this new agent initiated a return which was scheduled for 24/10/2023. The pick up could not happen on 24th because we were not available at home and I again had to call customer care. The agent rescheduled my pick up to 27/10/2023. Then on 25/10/2023 I received a call from pick up agent that he will arrive in 30mins for pick up of TV. He arrived, checked everything and went off with the item. It should be noted that completion of pick-up was not updated in the app which I specifically asked him to update. I raised the same issue with customer care and they told it will be updated within 24 hrs. Then at 3:00pm in the evening the pick-up guy called me stating that the serial no. was not matching and the he cannot complete return. He had checked everything before pick up and now they are saying that details are not matching. I was naturally furious. I denied to accept it back, but he (pick up guy) started threatening that if I don't take it back I will not get refund. Then today morning (26/10/2023) he re-delivered the item to me and took photos (the usual procedure) and went. He was also not clearly explaining why the return failed. All he is saying is that he is acting as per his supervisors orders. Then, I again called customer care informing them of this issue. The agent cross-checked the serial no. and said that all details are matching and that it is a mistake on the part of delivery agent. Now the pick up is scheduled for tomorrow (27/10/2023). Only God knows how many hurdles I have to cross to get my genuine refund. My only advice to whoever is reading this is, Amazon is a very good platform to purchase products as long as they are working. If you end up receiving a defective piece, you will definitely lose your peace of mind because of their conduct.",1

The webos feels laggy even in 2024 ..not what I expect from an LG tv .so absolutely not easy to use.
Got it in a sale ,so I guess you can consider it a value for money . But without magic remote , the experience ruins it . Had to purchase a magic remote. So consider 2k more. The LG support is excellent at least in bangalore .

I use it in the bedroom . And at least for the the sound is amazing even for a 20 watt speaker. I was genuinely surprised in a good way . So all in all of you are getting this 55 inch TV under 40k.. you can consider it . Else I suggest getting another tv from a different brand . Or you can wait it out for LG UT80 series as they are significantly better having tested it myself in an offline store .",3
7275,"The TV quality is excellent, but the installation took 5 days. All the technicians (scheduled from Amazon) were giving different excuses and not completing the job. Finally, I called LG customer care directly in the morning, and they sent someone to install it by the evening. The fixed wall mount was free and was brought by the LG technician.",3
7276,"Play Video
I think the tv is all good for entertainment.But I deducted two star for the following:
1) RECIEVED VA PANEL
2) When I tried checking panel for bleeding using white screen‚Ä¶ it is not uniformly white(Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an issue or not) but no case of screen bleeding..luckily.

**Lg team was superb and the WALL MOUNT is free provided by LG itself.",3
7277,"While the TV was at its best, but its old model and the OS was slow to respond. And the big thing about this is magical remote, very convenient to use... but the response time of the remote to tv is very slow compared to other tvs like reconnect etc. LG should look into this matter. Rest assured it was good one for home.",3
7278,"Very Good picture quality but laggy interface, not smooth as the other LG TVs",3
7279,"Picture quality is good.
But the operating system that is webos is very sluggish at times.
No magic remote is big disappointment.
Sound is ok and clear",3

7282,"Hello,
Today I bought my lg tv from Amazon. I happy with this. But the thing is delivery boy demanding me to give tip of 200 rupees. I have given 150 rupees. I feel very bad for this.",3
7283,Play Video,3
7284,"Not happy with the purchase. What I got was probably an ips panel, because the viewing angles were good. Overall picture quality was also quite good.

But the blacks were not that deep. It's OK when you watch TV during the day or with lights on. But if you watch by blacking out the room, the blacks (at the top and bottom.band, if the video doesn't cover full screen) were appearing quite grey.

But the bigger issue was that there were light spots at the bottom. (Pictures attached). So I then played a full black video to check the screen and I could see multiple white patches throughout the screen. It's visible only when black plays though.

The sound quality was quite average. I have a slightly large room (15x20ft) and I had to play in 100% volume to get decent sound. There is cinema mode, in which sound comes even louder. But only the treble increases, not the bass, so I didn't like how it sounded in that mode. And switched back to standard mode at 100%.

I also noticed some motion blur. Not in some high speed video, but normal hand waving. But I was able to tinker with some settings and it improved. I reduced super resolution and also changed motion settings. I dont know which one made the difference, but it was tolerable after that.

Amazon was quick in their response and the brand technician visited the next day to check. He confirmed this is a panel defect, said that he will get the tv replaced in 2-3 days. But he went and filed a report saying that there is no issue with the TV. I kept waiting for the TV for 3-4 days. Then had to call amazon 2-3 times and finally they agreed to send one more technician. 10 days over, and now I was at the end of my patience level. These buggers confirmed appointment after 2 days and didnt turn up at the scheduled time of 10am. There was no response from anyone till 6pm, and finally after a few more calls, amazon agreed to take back the product and refund me. I was really worried if I will be stuck with a defective product after paying 66k. But relived that they are refunding it. Gotta thank amazon for that.

On second thought, i feel even if I get good quality of same TV, its not worth the price, given the sound quality and not so deep blacks. Hence opted for refund instead of exchange. Plus I feel there was no point in paying extra for a ""brand"" since their service was pathetic.",2
7285,"1. Display is fine

7291,"While the picture quality and sound is great.
Lg's insistence on webOS is significantly disappointing.

Their store does not have a good selection of apps. Sideloading Android apps isnt possible and webOS UX leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically this limits what your tv is capable of today with Google or Apple Tv. This forces users to add on an additional device to compensate for the lack of features which is force limited by webOS and its ridiculous limited development roadmap.

Please improve this LG.",3
7292,"amazon delivered this item within the mentioned timeline but they did not inform the installation person about the installation.

After delivery we waited 48 hrs for installation and no one contacted us. After 48 hrs I called LG services and booked installation but after 4-5 times contacted to LG by call and WhatsApp and after 48 hrs (totally after 5 days) only person was contacted for installation. Amanon did not mention this installation process while checking in flipkart same product they have mentioned this information clearly.

During these service center contacts, they had one person's number to contact but that person said I was not covering that area and asked me to contact another one person. Still, that second person never answered the call even calling more than 10 times.

The only good thing is after getting communication from that installation person he completed that entire process within one hour with politeness and needness. for him only this 3 star otherwise zero star only.

Worst service experience ever, recently purchased a Samsung TV and they contacted me and did installation within a single day very satisfying. This issue should be due to the amazon not due to LG. They should inform the LG service team about this process seems amazon not did this if i am not wrong.

Anyway i prepare Flipkart only for all the major purchases like mobile, laptops so many things but very first time went to amazon but very bad experience",3

This one is just the opposite. The soundstage is not clean. The audio has too much of distortion. The mids are not clean. Too much overpowering lows creating distortion for the highs.
Bluetooth is patchy: signal intermittently drops even within 10m LoS range.
AI sound mode makes it worse.
I regret buying this because of the sound.",3
7302,"I'll start with the good parts. Panel is bright, picture quality is great(clear), audio is perfect for us. We have a 14'x14' room and we have to keep the brightness at 60% else it gets too bright. Vibrant mode is tooo vibrant. We use the standard/film mode so that colors look natural. Audio is loud enough for us. We usually use about 30% for reality shows. I love the clear voice mode which reduces background sound and clarifies dialogues.

Now the software. It sucks. Does not support discovery+ even though previous year model (UQ series) did. Apps have bugs and I guess they prioritize fixing them for android over webOS since it has more users. All reviewers online show how snappy the os is and how fast it loads. But what they don't show is how much the apps lag in animations. I have a firetv stick to compare webOS against.",3

Service guys are claiming that it got damaged from inside. But when we discussed with other TV guys, they ensured that when the display gets bad it shows the same sign. And now they are asking for 27k for repair even when the television is in warranty.

This is a scam which is being run as a post service. I will add the same post on twitter.",1

Cons:
1.Build quality not upto the mark.. panel gaps between PANEL and bezels are evident
2.WEB OS, though said to be improved, but not impressive and not user friendly as Android OS
3.Glitches while using the interface as it is not that fluidic and was somewhat irritating

7315,"A TV only has two main functions.

1/ Display - which this TV handles very very impressively. The display is one of the best in the market in this segment (hands down to this)

2/ Sound - although the sound is clear and crispy, I do not know why nobody has ever mentioned the fact the TV volume is way too low. I have to put my TV in 75-80% volume to even hear what is being played.

I could find only 1 review that says this point.

Please be careful when you are buying this TV. If u have a external speaker then this would be the best TV to get.
if not, THE TV VOLUME IS WAY TOOOOOO LOW TO HEAR. CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR TV VOLUME TO 75-85 TO EVEN HEAR IT PROPERLY.

I am telling this because I already have as a same TV of 2022 model - 43UQ7500 and the sound quality and loudness is just awesome. You don't even need a external speaker but this TV is failing in this area.

I HAVE RETUNED THIS TV TO GET THE OLDER MODEL. (except for the bezel older model is a great overall experience. Bezel and TV thickness won't matter much after sometime)

Expecting a smooth resolution, I awaited the arranged pickup for the return. However, the experience took a turn for the worse when the pickup team arrived, insisting that I contact Amazon to uninstall and repack the TV before they could retrieve it.

This runaround was incredibly frustrating, and the lack of coordination between Amazon's customer service and their logistics team only exacerbated the situation.

For 3 weeks I spoke to them regarding my tv issue and spoke to more than 10 people constantly everyone also saying they‚Äôll call in one hour. That one hour finished 2 weeks back.

7423,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of dealing with LG, and I feel compelled to share my experience in hopes of warning others. From start to finish, the quality of service provided by this brand has been nothing short of abysmal.

Firstly, the display of my TV, which I bought just 6 months ago, broke unexpectedly. When I reached out to LG Service for support, I was shocked to find that they demanded 100% of the TV‚Äôs original cost to fix the broken display. This exorbitant charge is completely unreasonable, especially considering that the TV was still relatively new.

As if the cost wasn't bad enough, the customer service was appalling. The representatives I spoke to were incredibly rude and dismissive. They showed no empathy or willingness to help resolve my issue. Repeated calls for support went unanswered, leaving me frustrated and feeling helpless.

Overall, my experience with LG has been extremely disappointing. The combination of poor service, outrageous repair costs, and rude customer support has convinced me to never purchase from this brand again. I strongly advise others to think twice before investing in a product from LG Brand. There are many other brands out there that offer better quality and customer service.",1

Purchased this with lots of hopes that LG will be better than other competitors. The machine appears to be good but a weird noise coming out during spinning cycle and one can easily notice the suspect noise at the end of the spinning cycle, see the attached video clip.

1. No branding and indication (or stickers) about DIRECT DRIVE on the machine.

2. No branding and indication about 6 MOTIONS SENSE wash on the machine. Only GOD knows which program works with 6 motions sense. I guess only 1 or 2 motion senses works for per cycle.

3. No indication about AI on the machine.

4. No proper indication about 2 Years Warranty + 10 Years Warranty (Motor) on the machine.

5. If it is installed properly on the floor vibration can be reduced.

6. Anti rat is made with cotton box paper. (Should have given a plastic or fiber).

7. Water inlet pipe is very short. Should have given at least 2 meter.

8. LG ThinQ app does it job fairly.

But I‚Äôm facing a major issue of weird NOISE coming out from machine during spinning cycle which I never heard from other washing machines. Not sure if this noise is due to defective DRAIN PUMP or Motor itself.

Trying hard for replacement but Amazon CC telling that they will raise request to LG brand for inspection then decides after their inspection report to Amazon. I don‚Äôt know how long takes for the whole process. Meanwhile my RETURN POLICY WILL BE EXPIRED SOON.",2

Directly contact brand for installation.

Second scam is exchange, don't believe the exchange value mentioned in amazon website it is totally a scam by amazon. They will inspect your machine and after that they will tell this and that as if we need to keep the machine like new one as when brought. They will denie for exchange or will insist us to give it for scrap rate. So don't fall for exchange offer, better to give it to local waste collection, so that we no need to pay the exchange amount in return to them while delivery.

Third about machine, don't go for Front load. Top load is best. As attached in video. Small cloths will get stuck in door. We need separate mesh bags to put small clothes. Compared to top load we can only put less number of clothes, machine is also too heavy to lift and move, that again become headache to clean the floor where the machine is kept. Washing, Stain and grease removal is good when Compared to Top load.",2

But.....
It it takes more time apart from the set timer for a particular wash cycle which is not mentioned in the manual suppose if u set a wash cycle and it shows a time to complete the wash but the machine takes some times 20% more time to complete that wash cycle.
Second this model has only two temperature options max 60 degree centigrade which is not enough when you have to remove hard stains.
Although this machine shows max 1400 RPM for spin but one gets same result as of 700rpm Semi Automatic washing machine .
Buyers should take these things into consideration while choosing a machine.",3

I have been grappling with a persistent issue where the washing machine intermittently turns on and off by itself. Despite visits from an LG service representative, this problem remains unresolved.

Initially, the representative made some efforts to address the issue but ultimately determined that a panel replacement was necessary. Since then, I have been waiting patiently for further instructions or action on the replacement. However, my repeated attempts to follow up with the LG Service Centre in Raipur have been met with indifference and lack of urgency.

I have reached out via mail and phone multiple times, yet there has been no follow-up or resolution to my case. The lack of responsiveness and failure to address the problem reflect poorly on LG's customer service and support.

Given this experience, I strongly advise against purchasing LG washing machines. The product itself may be of decent quality, but the service and support, at least in my case, have been utterly disappointing. Save yourself the hassle and consider alternatives with better customer service.",1

I mean, sure, I was expecting a bit of noise - all machines make some. But this thing takes it to a whole new level. It's like a mini earthquake and you can hear it in every corner of the house. It's seriously irritating and disrupts everything.

I thought LG was a solid brand, but this noise issue makes me question that. The washing itself seems okay, but honestly, the noise overshadows any good it does.

I've tried everything - adjusting the load, making sure it's level, doing all the maintenance stuff they recommend. But the noise just won't quit.

I really hope LG takes this seriously and does something about it. I get that machines make noise, but this is just too much. I regret buying it - I wish I had gone with a different brand or model.

To sum up, this LG washer's noise level is a total downer. It might clean well, but the constant racket is a deal-breaker for me. LG needs to fix this if they want happy customers in the future.",1
7494,Drum is small,1
7495,"Who is at Fault? LG, Seller(Dawntech Electronics or Amazon. I ordered a 9 kg fully automatic front load washing machine of LG which was sold by Dawntech Electronics. Delivery by Amazon was superfast i.e. within one day. Technician from LG came as per the scheduled appointment and he was co-operative. But here comes the product. The drum of the product was all rusted ( Jung lagi Hui thi). I was surprised, how come stainless steel drum can have rust. Here comes all the culprit in light, The LG electronics who makes product of such pathetic quality. The Dawntech Electronics who is major culprit of selling the used and returned item before proper inspection and last one is Amazon who deals with such kind of seller on their platform. It was my rakshabandhan gift to my sister and they spoiled my day with her. Thank You Dawntech Electronics, LG and Amazon.",1

After replacement received an opened product which was packed as new from outside but when opened the product was clearly visible as used and even the LG technician didn't inform that it's a repacked product. As it was a gift to my parents, they didn't know it's was repacked Product and neither LG or Amazon helped to resolve the issue.

I received the product on 12th March and installed on 13th. Worked well for the first 12 days. Then water started leaking from drum. Seems some screw slot was weak and hence slowly it startes to leak after few days. Now they are not taking it back as the return and replacement policy is just for ten days. So they will not replace the defective product they delivered, they just service the defective product that was delivered. Brilliant strategy for clearance sale.",1

7512,I purchased this machine from Amazon and received a damaged piece. I thought that i might have happened by chance. Then i placed an order for a new machine but white colour and to my surprise the second machine was also damaged. The shocking part is that the box was totally unaffected while the machine had a big dent on the front panel. How is that possible ?? Hence i have come to this conclusion.,1
7513,"It‚Äôs been 2 weeks i bought the washing machine, it‚Äôs tumbling highly , vibrating . And the size of product from online and offline varies almost 8 inches, a wonder , when I seen the difference in sizes pointed by brother. Choose to buy products from offline stores only.

2Inlet pipe design is very bad. So need to wait along time to fill water
3Cleaning is average
4More time to complete each cycle
5We feel some wash and rinse movements are unnecessary
6 Not satisfied with spinning. Clothes have high water content after spinning.

Conclusion:
Not recommended to purchase",3
7639,"The machine is not wow as it is slow processing and the machine also removes the soaked water automatically when started, earlier this was not the caee.",3
7640,LG machine was delivered pan invoice and warranty card not given. Was asking for service center bill for installation.,3
7641,They simplified programs and it's not working fine.,3
7642,Dent at the right side arm.,3
7643,Not good for stained clothes.. Just washing and removing the bad odour. If you have kids in home not recommended to buy this product because usually their clothes have loads of stains... And also washing time is more than that shown on the display..,3
7644,"Don't buy, don't buy",3
7645,"I didn‚Äôt like the quality of washing.mostly cloth comes out as IS, need to use brush to clean the minor spots.",3
7646,"Noise level is so low.
Water flow is damn slow as it takes so long for even a quick wash. Response from machine after a key press has a lot of delay.

Delivery of product was on time but, installation from LG never happened .
Better prepare to install yourself",3
7647,"Compared to my previous Samsung 6.5 kg machine this one is small. Not many functions as my previous machine.
Unsatisfied by purchase.",3
7648,The service is worst adjustable legs are missing from the product delivered we complain to customer care they are not solving the problem it is nearly a week still the problem is not solved very worst service,3
7649,"Why isn‚Äôt LG giving a 5 year warranty upfront and add the amount to its product price. There‚Äôs a price for cleaning liquid,
Price for 3 year additional warranty,
Price for conditioner.
The installation was traumatic. So was the agent. There was no patient explanation from the agent. On the whole I would only blame LG for subjecting the customer to this unpleasant installation process. When we buy a LG product we are buying a trusted brand. We don‚Äôt need to spend extra amount to make it workable and long lasting.
Disappointed with this LG Washing machine.",3

7652,Machine washability is poor and No Rat protection,3
7653,"The spin function is not working properly, clothes at the bottom are watery.
If the machine is initially set to run at 21 mins, it doesn't complete it that set time of 21mins, it takes more time.
The demo person for useless, he didn't know the functionalities of the machine, I had learn by reading the manual and watching you tube videos.",2
7654,"I bought this last month and even before completing a month it started displaying the door error repetitively. After contacting to customer support he visited and said need a motherboard replacement and so they did. This is unexpected from this brand. Also, the return/replace window was already closed which was of very short time span.",2
7655,No exchange was given for my old whirlpool washing machine even though it was in good condition. Is it justified,2
7656,"I purchased this washing machine because of my limited budget and keeping in view of its affordable prices, brand name, quality, services etc. Although the machine is good, I returned it on the next day as I am not happy with the drum rotation speed during Washing mode. It rotates so slowly just like a baby in the credle. How can we expect the cloths will be cleaned with such a slow speed of drum rotation? Earlier, I used Samsung top load machine, in which the drum speed is sufficient enought to wash the clothes. This is because in the LG motor is direct drive (invertor) and Samsung is belt drive (non Invertor and old model). Since, now most of the top load machines are upgraded to direct and inverter model, same problem may be there in all brands, I think. Hence, the makers should change the program code to increase the drum rotation speed durig washing mode. Keeping in view of this problem, now I placed order for Samsung Front load machine with (Belt drive and Digital inverter) model. Although, reviewers say that belt need to be replaced after few years, I think it is not a big issue as it may cost hardly Rs2-300 only. However, I naver faced problem with the belt during last 12 years in my Samsung top load machine. So, my suggestion to all buyers is try to see the washing mode speed in the top load inverter model machines in your near and dear homes before purchasing the top load machines. Otherwise, you may regret like me for buying it. Now, I have to see how the front load washing machine will perform. Since, it was widely used, I hope no issues with it.",3
7657,After wash the clothes are not cleaned up well.,3
7658,Writing review after more than a year of using this product. Everything is good except it doesn't remove stains. I have tried using different brands of detergent to check that but realised it's the machine that is not good enough to remove stains. Quite disappointed as I am stuck with this machine.,3
7659,Very silent top load machine. There's no competition for direct drive technology. Earlier I was using a direct drive front load of LG which lasted 17 years without service. Let's see how long this one lasts. Only one complaint that clothes tangle more in this top load one when compared to front load model.,3
7660,"I am writing this review after one month of using the washing mc/.

I had a similar model older version washing machine of LG, in which the spin drying was very good and clothes' came out almost dry. In this m/c clothes come out moist and has more water in it , hence taking taking more time for drying in monsoon. Showed the issue to LG technician who said nothing can be done about it.
Also time taken for washing is more for same amount of clothes when compared to the older m/c . Time has increased by approx 10 mins . In older washing m/c wash cycle used to start immediately , but now it takes 1 to 2 mins to start due to m/c having too many sensors I guess

Otherwise m/c works very good and is almost noiseless",3
7661,The features shown on Amazon are not available. It doesn't have soft lid closing. You will get better features for the same price if you buy samsung ecobubble. Made a big mistake. I can say I was cheated. The features they shows in the video are from a more expensive model. That's how they are making so many people buy. The only good thing is inverter motor. Otherwise it's worth not more than 12k. Washing quality is average. I paid the price you guys save yourself,2
7662,"I couldn't feel the washing quality of the washing machine. Its tear all of my bedsheet towel cloth. I was very panic about the cloth for each and every time when before i put the cloths into the machine.
Especially in the rinse cycle its just take 3min and drains the water. I wonder how could rise the cloth with in 3min.after finishing complete program, i took one washed cloth and tipped into the water ...
The water have full if detergent residuals and water colour have changed. I think this is major flaw and its determined the washing quality. You cannot change rinse duration of the machine. Its fixed program.",3
7663,,2
7664,Once product is delivered I saw it was damaged and requested for replacing they schedule replacement,2
7665,Price is okay but within 3 months of purchase there was machine's timer issues,2
7666,"Same make and model - the built-in features have changed. In the old one, we could pour water with lid open while the machine is taking water from the tap. This permitted user to fill the drum shade faster, especially in areas where water pressure from the main pipeline is low. Now it takes ages to finish the wash cycle. Bad safety feature results costs time. TIME IS MONEY.",2
7667,"It mentioned to be 8kg, but doesn‚Äôt carry that kind of load. It makes a lot of noise if the clothes pass 5kg of load. LG needs to keep up to it‚Äôs promises, or else stop selling the machine in the name of 8kg!",2
7668,"Spin is very slow, cloth are not drying properly. Not satisfied.",2
7669,Not much cloths can be wash at one go and the washing quality is not so good. Earlier we were having Samsung washing machine of same 6.5kg but number of cloths washed at one time was much higher,3
7670,"I was using Samsung washing machine earlier, and recently buy the LG one, not happy with performance & cleanness.
This machine having following manufacture problems:
1. water level not come as expected, even programmed multiple times.
2. inflow of water very slow where thee is no water line issue.
3. I need to spin again every time to remove water from cloth.
4. Loader is not rotating in good speed, so clan clan is not happening as expected

Think 2 times before buy any LS products.",1
7671,"Title: Beware of Poor Service and Product Issues

Review:

I purchased this washing machine from Amazon and had a terrible experience. The LG technician who installed it lacked knowledge, and the machine didn't wash clothes properly, leaving detergent and damaging them.

Despite changing to matte liquid detergent, the issues persisted. Amazon customer service was unhelpful, with each executive giving different advice and failing to follow up. They claimed they are just middlemen and couldn't do anything until LG provided feedback. On the other hand, the LG technician never visited after multiple follow-ups.

Amazon should take full responsibility for providing a replacement or refund since the customer has paid them. Be cautious when buying a washing machine from Amazon due to potential poor service and product problems.",1

I told him I won't buy the new washing machine if this is not exchanged at the agreed rate, then he said he will just reduce Rs 600 against Rs 2800, I agreed and I took few pics of the old machine and I told him I will intimate this to Amazon with these pics, he immediately told don't do that I don't want any money, I'll take the old machine as is.",1

For example this is unable to rotate clothes up & down . I continuously observed that the top clothes remain at the top all the time then how it can wash? Also during rinsing it is doing the same. I need LG to respond on this. It is expected that all clothes to be submerged and agitated in different direction so that all clothes got rotated and washed properly. Overall it is not up to the mark.",2

The outer door don't have auto closing function.
Very minimum functions for any other needs to modify the available functions

Please demonstrate & guide properly to the subsequent deals to other customers on this model. People got so mush trust & reliability on your site, which should not be broken.

3. Water level diagnosis is not shown transparently once after the auto diagnosis over and many times, clothes are not sink fully.

4. There is no soaking option provided in any wash program.

5. Overall efficiency is not upto the level of expectation.

6. Also there is no exchange option available if you want to replace with another model, they will refund only so we cannot avail all the discounts as per the original offer.

While exchange, the person who came for collecting old machine along with new delivery, demanded 50 % of the exchange value in cash without any bill. Otherwise he threaten that he won't accept the exchange. So we forcefully paid the extra cash as hidden loss.",3

I got it delivered on May 2, 4 days gone and apart from an SMS no one really contacted for installation which was a surprise. After multiple escalations and calls LG decided to make a call to me on the 4th day.

Purchased this with lots of hopes that LG will be better than other competitors. The machine appears to be good but a weird noise coming out during spinning cycle and one can easily notice the suspect noise at the end of the spinning cycle, see the attached video clip.

1. No branding and indication (or stickers) about DIRECT DRIVE on the machine.

2. No branding and indication about 6 MOTIONS SENSE wash on the machine. Only GOD knows which program works with 6 motions sense. I guess only 1 or 2 motion senses works for per cycle.

3. No indication about AI on the machine.

4. No proper indication about 2 Years Warranty + 10 Years Warranty (Motor) on the machine.

5. If it is installed properly on the floor vibration can be reduced.

6. Anti rat is made with cotton box paper. (Should have given a plastic or fiber).

7. Water inlet pipe is very short. Should have given at least 2 meter.

8. LG ThinQ app does it job fairly.

But I‚Äôm facing a major issue of weird NOISE coming out from machine during spinning cycle which I never heard from other washing machines. Not sure if this noise is due to defective DRAIN PUMP or Motor itself.

Trying hard for replacement but Amazon CC telling that they will raise request to LG brand for inspection then decides after their inspection report to Amazon. I don‚Äôt know how long takes for the whole process. Meanwhile my RETURN POLICY WILL BE EXPIRED SOON.",2

Directly contact brand for installation.

Second scam is exchange, don't believe the exchange value mentioned in amazon website it is totally a scam by amazon. They will inspect your machine and after that they will tell this and that as if we need to keep the machine like new one as when brought. They will denie for exchange or will insist us to give it for scrap rate. So don't fall for exchange offer, better to give it to local waste collection, so that we no need to pay the exchange amount in return to them while delivery.

Third about machine, don't go for Front load. Top load is best. As attached in video. Small cloths will get stuck in door. We need separate mesh bags to put small clothes. Compared to top load we can only put less number of clothes, machine is also too heavy to lift and move, that again become headache to clean the floor where the machine is kept. Washing, Stain and grease removal is good when Compared to Top load.",2

But.....
It it takes more time apart from the set timer for a particular wash cycle which is not mentioned in the manual suppose if u set a wash cycle and it shows a time to complete the wash but the machine takes some times 20% more time to complete that wash cycle.
Second this model has only two temperature options max 60 degree centigrade which is not enough when you have to remove hard stains.
Although this machine shows max 1400 RPM for spin but one gets same result as of 700rpm Semi Automatic washing machine .
Buyers should take these things into consideration while choosing a machine.",3

7752,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with both the LG washing machine and the associated service centre. I have been grappling with a persistent issue where the washing machine intermittently turns on and off by itself. Despite visits from an LG service representative, this problem remains unresolved.

Initially, the representative made some efforts to address the issue but ultimately determined that a panel replacement was necessary. Since then, I have been waiting patiently for further instructions or action on the replacement. However, my repeated attempts to follow up with the LG Service Centre in Raipur have been met with indifference and lack of urgency.

I have reached out via mail and phone multiple times, yet there has been no follow-up or resolution to my case. The lack of responsiveness and failure to address the problem reflect poorly on LG's customer service and support.

Given this experience, I strongly advise against purchasing LG washing machines. The product itself may be of decent quality, but the service and support, at least in my case, have been utterly disappointing. Save yourself the hassle and consider alternatives with better customer service.",1

So, I got this LG washing machine recently and, honestly, I'm kind of let down. The biggest gripe? The crazy noise it makes while running.

I mean, sure, I was expecting a bit of noise - all machines make some. But this thing takes it to a whole new level. It's like a mini earthquake and you can hear it in every corner of the house. It's seriously irritating and disrupts everything.

I thought LG was a solid brand, but this noise issue makes me question that. The washing itself seems okay, but honestly, the noise overshadows any good it does.

I've tried everything - adjusting the load, making sure it's level, doing all the maintenance stuff they recommend. But the noise just won't quit.

I really hope LG takes this seriously and does something about it. I get that machines make noise, but this is just too much. I regret buying it - I wish I had gone with a different brand or model.

To sum up, this LG washer's noise level is a total downer. It might clean well, but the constant racket is a deal-breaker for me. LG needs to fix this if they want happy customers in the future.",1

Here comes all the culprit in light, The LG electronics who makes product of such pathetic quality. The Dawntech Electronics who is major culprit of selling the used and returned item before proper inspection and last one is Amazon who deals with such kind of seller on their platform.

1) I didn't like about the machine is that it doesn't display the settings on the left side. It calculates only after the machine is turned on. So we will not know how long the wash program takes until it starts.
2) The machine sometimes stops in the middle of the program. or the timer stays the same for a good amount of time. After calling the serviceman, he said that it's due to the outlet hose which is not properly connected. So I will have to wait and find out it's because of that.",2

Either we could reach out to lg or we could reach out to amazon. This created more confusion. Inspection first and then product return later by Amazon created more displeasure. We exchanged our old washing machine so we got 1.8k return while buying this product. But at the time of exchange pickup the person said we should give him 900 because our old washing machine has rust. We have given him 900. But when we returned the product we got back the total minus exchange amount. So effectively we have paid 900 for amazon to takeaway our old washing machine.

Normal Machine wash clothes....but LG machine wash clothes with dance and drill music. Not sure what it's celebrating....bt The way it's vibrating and sounding....it seems this machine is reproducing another machine and about to give birth another machine.

Update: came to know that machine was alright but the technician sent by LG service centre had no clue about how to install. He installed and operated the machine without taking out transit bolts which ultimately damaged machine.
LG service centre has worst attitude to address such issue.... first they send technician without any experience of installation and later they refused to facilitate return process.",1

Every month you need to tub clean and only with the LG powder, also in his backpack, that was Rs. 1k. He was kind enough to inform us that if we use any other powder the tub will turn black

I've been using this machine for 2 weeks now. Delhivery came from my nearby area, came next day. I've got open box inspection and machine was in good condition. Basically this machine is just like other washing machines, nothing as such special in it. You get 3 modes, strong, normal, gentle; which just change machine runtime vs pause time. I found some pros and cons listed below :

Cons:
1) Lint filters are useless until machine is full till neck, you can see attached video. And this is the biggest drawback in this machine.
2) 'Wind dry technology', 'roller jet' etc are just useless marketing gimmicks
3) Buzzer plays for about 15 seconds & No option to turn off the buzzer. So you can't wash if someone is sleeping. I personally don't like buzzer sounds.
4) Lead & inlet hose is small. This machine has small lead, you will have to move machine near electric board. But it also has small inlet pipe, so you will have to move it near to tap as well. Solution is; either you extend lead or extend hose. I've extended both.
5) Tyres move only in one axis can not freely move machine. This is not a problem for me as I keep machine fixed.
6) Buttons are not waterproof, and filmsy
7) Only 5yrs warranty on motor
8) No mention if motors are copper or not
9) Sharp edges on covers. I got hurt twice (you can see in attached pictures)

Pros:
1) Autorestrart after power restore is a good feature for busy people
2) Average noise (this is neither a pro, nor a con)
3) Good size for 8KG
4) Can wash clothes decently (but lints are stuck to clothes as lint filter is useless)

Overall this is just a machine, you can buy this or any other, it does not make any difference. Delivery was good, 5 star for delivery.

Edit after 6 month usage: Reduced rating to 1 star. The machine is so flimsy and built with poor material. All buttons got loose, machine started to shake, and as said earlier Lint filer is useless, you see lint all over your clothes after the wash. Not at all recommended.",1

The size is ideal for a small family or a couple. Spinner size is really small and i expected that. Not an issue, but will be a hassle to handle large size comforters (if you use those).
Base is solid with NO WHEELS, just so you know.
I give 2/5 for accessories - the inlet pipe and the drain pipe appear to be of poor quality and i am guessing these are not covered under 2 year comprehensive warranty.
One would have a higher expectation of a noted Korean brand, bet they don't sell such poor quality accessories back home in Korea.
Amazon Service was flawless with timely delivery, open box verification of product.",3
8040,Model was received in ok condition. Everything is fine in this machine except the dryer section which accomodates only 2-3 clothes to be properly dried.

8075,"This washing machine motor is made of aluminum Wash Motor and Spin Motors both have Half efficiency besides copper compared in robust performance. Copper can carry almost twice the current capacity of aluminum, which makes them slightly smaller in size than aluminum wound Motors, and has the better long-life capability and load-carrying transmission of washing clothes. The One Kg washing machine has to use 69 Watt Copper motor and for 11.0 Kg machine, it needs 760 Watt motor of copper to wash 11.0-kilogram dry clothes. While here LG Company gives 410 Watt only Aluminium Motor of Washer. The clothes Dryer is also of Plastic which is broken after getting hard over usage time years which is also not good for the long Run years at home. Besides they may give a light Stainless Steel washer if they wanted to give in the dryer side. The dryer used 360 Watt motor which is very low in it but the motor again here is an Aluminium motor and the dryer can only dry 8 Kg weight clothes in it. The Body is full of plastic and with time passage it cracked on long usage. So the dear company for any washing including LG Company is fooling around in INDIA for this as consumers do not know deep down knowledge in INDIA of this. The outer Plastic material if broken or torn down has no warranty of one single day from the Date of Purchase of the invoice of the washing machine. The Rotation Per Minute of the Wash motor and how much it revolves clockwise and anti-clockwise are also not mentioned in the Wash motor specifications which knowingly hides so that customers do not know how much time it turned in one minute time. The warranty is 2 years after that if the motor stopped then the Service charges Rs 700 to give to get the motor changed freely in 5 years.
++ One request to all consumers and buyers read the wattage in the back of the washing machine and booklet that what motor of the washer and dryer you getting individually in each motor. ++",2

This machine leaves stains on the cloths, also damages the cloth. Even we tried washing only new cloths but still it leaves stains. I raised complaints many times but technician gives different reasons everytime. Even I wrote to the CEO office of LG but the same typical process was followed - ticked assigned to a service center, technician visited, this time even technician cleaned the cloths and found the machine faulty. After that no action is taken.

I had also purchased LG Split AC which has cooling problem. So overall very bad experience with LG and very pathetic service by them.

The service center has never contacted us on their own to inform us of any details. We've attempted to contact them ourselves but they rarely pick up our calls. The few times they've picked up our calls, they hear us out but don't provide any concrete info or solutions. Once they even hung up on us. Customer care just asks us to contact service center directly.

After 15 days, we escalated our issue with LG. They seemed to take us seriously in the initial call but there has been no communication after that. No progress updates. No estimation on how long till the repair can be finished.

8135,"1 day impression...

I had lot of expectations from brand lg, delivery was on time and installation was quick done on same day.

Installation experience...
Installation guy lacks knowledge about product. He also sold me desclaer powder for 750 rs. Which was available on amzon around 300 rs. Ouch !.

Over all machine looks premium. Packeging was good.No dent or scratches.
Need 16 ampere power socket or adaptaer to power on machine.
Also Special faucet or tap available in market for wahshing machine which was needed.
As machine weight is above 60 kgs becarefull while handling.

Washing experience...
After all necessary arrangements ran quick wash cycle with prewash which was 10+30 min. For 4 clothes.
Cleaning was not satisfactory, but spinning and rinsing removed 80% of water. Jeans felt more wet than other clothes.

Most dumb part WiFi connection
You need to download lg thinq app from play store.
Your phone must have NFC to read nfc tag placed inside machine.
Thier is no dedicated WiFi button available on machine panel like other lg machines.
Lots of entry level smartphone don't have NFC tag reder. Its a very dumb thing when same thing can be done by cheap printed Qr code.

Other observations.
Washing drum has lot of vertical space but lacks depth like Bosch washing machine. Also looks smaller than Bosch. May be due to direct drive space is constrained at back.
It is new model for 2021, mine have mfg. Date Dec 2020.",3

Easy to use LG user interface. The biggest issue so far is the noise at spin cycle at 1200(Cotton). It makes loud noise for this kinda front loader. Also the vibration during spin cycle is excessive.

8138,The noise level is next to negligible.Wash is good .But it shakes vigorously during spin and it starts rotating. Cant use 1200 rpm spin because of this issue. If you have a un-even floor you will have to buy a stand to keep it in place to prevent machine's motion during spin,3
