0,"Service center using fake gas & local copper pipe, overcharging, customer care is helpless","Using Fake gas & copper pipe:
The service center (Royal Services Goa) used local copper pipes, several leftover pieces of insulation (instead of one continuous roll), and it seems they filled the AC with fake gas. AC was using full power but not cooling at all, the inside room temperature was higher than outside temperature & they were knowingly reporting wrong gas pressures to LG to cover up. I sent the pictures of the correct gas pressure to LG but the ASM took no action & service center stopped providing service and then closed the complaint. The installation technician also showed me samples of poor-quality copper pipes which he admitted were not from LG but from the local shop.

Overcharging & Arm twisting:
Service center said official company rates are for showing only. If I wanted officially published rates, the installation will not happen. That is exactly what they did. They kept me waiting for 10 days and then closed the complaint with reason ""customer does not want installation"" even though the matter was under escalation to with CEO's e-mail address.

Excess charges:
Extra Copper Pipe with insulation & vinyl tape: Official Rate 850/meter, Service center wanted: 1130 + gst
Power chord: Official Rate 60/meter, Service center wanted 180/meter
Gas refilling charge on brand new installation: Official rate: Free, its included, Service center wanted: 1500 + GST

Even after the matter was raised with the Area Service Manager (ASM), the ASM instead of upholding official rates said its not profitable for the service center & wanted me to directly negotiate unofficial rates with the service center.

AC not installed in 10 days:
Since I insisted on official installation prices, the service center stopped responding to calls or messages. The matter was escalated to the ASM but nothing changed.

Useless customer care:
The matter was escalated using the write to CEO link. This turned to be a total waste of time as you only get directed to customer care and get generic responses. They forwarded my complaint to the persons against whom the complaint was made. No one from LG customer care even called to find out whats going on & the harassment only increased. Amazon also escalated the issue at their end but the installation was not done in 10 days. Finally, I gave up and returned the AC.

This review is from someone who used to be a loyal LG customer. But now LG is not what it used to be.","Apr, 2024",1,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Air Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE1, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC
1,Copper pipe was missing,"Cooling, efficiency, everything is good but the copper pipe was missing in the amazon package. Had to pay for the pipe and then calim the refund from amazon.

2,Good product with poor installation service,"Product is good but installing this thing is nightmare. Installation is done by brand itself on amazon & by third party installer on another e-commerce website. Brand installation is alway bad.
After hundreds of calls to LG, I received first technician visit after 7 days of delivery, when technician came to home, he told me he didn’t carry any proper rotary hammer drill and having only drill machine and mechanical hammer to make a hole, I refused to install as this could damage wall.
Again after hundreds of calls to LG, three days later another technician visited, this time he was very professional and had all the tools.
So yeah, I recommend this product to someone who have a lot of patience. Product seems good after one week of uses.","Jun, 2024",3,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Air Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE1, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

4,Installation,"The product is really good and nice cooling, less noise. For installation they charge more than what's shown on Amazon app. Standard installation they charge 1415 and we have to pay extra for stand and the three pin plug and other accessories and for installation of the outdoor unit stand separately which was around 1200. LG sent an installation service fee bill of Rs.2596 but the service team charged me more. I wish the right expectations were set before installation about the charges, hence writing it here, it may cost around 3k for installation alone!!

6,Good AC but Pathetic Installation,"Purchased the AC last week.Installation was a pain .Everyday someone claiming to be from LG would call only for not to turn up.Finally after 5 days a guy who pretended to be AC technician visited for installation.The guy was more suited for road construction rather than AC installation.He neither had patience to explain anything nor he had any skills to carry out installation.Left without giving Demo.For an AC costing north of 40k Atleast LG should send someone who knows the job.
Coming to the AC,it does work properly.There is no backlight in Remote which can be irritating at night without lights.AC is almost soundless ,cools my 140 sq feet room within 10-15 mins.","Apr, 2024",3,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Air Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE1, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC
7,Product quality is good but service needs to be improved,Product Quality is good but service needs to be improved.

10,Don't go for Inverter AC for domestic use.,"- Inverter AC is a scam and companies like LG are cashing on it.
- LG doesn't not provide Copper Condenser or Copper Pipes to OD unit.
- please double check with other brands as well, as the No1 Ac company is also No1 in Cheating customers. Very frustrating... Inverter will work fine for a couple of years ,after you will start getting problems..

12,Not satisfy with product.,"It's been 2 years using this LG AC.
Not satisfied with the quality.
Doesn't cool fast and less cooling as compare to others.
I have samsung AC as well been using for 3 years, cools faster and make room SHIMLA within 10-15 mins.
LG claims that it consumes less Watts, but didn't see much difference as compare to Samsung AC.
Bought Samsung AC for less than the price of LG AC (almost 10k less )and it is older than LG AC, yet faster cooling and totally value for money and satisfied.
Don't go for LG AC.
LG AC has VIRAT mode as well. Just faster the Fan speed and does nothing.","Jul, 2024",2,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Air Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE1, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

14,May work better for smaller rooms,"I bought this AC in May 2024 and have been using it for couple of weeks now. Earlier I had a 10 yrs old 1.5 ton fixed speed Carrier AC, deployed in my living room/kitchen area with a size of approx 150 sq ft and it would chill the room. This LG AC is able to moderate the temperature to some extent but the air flow is barely noticeable even in HC mode, till the time I am sitting in front of it. This AC does not justify the steep cost!
Since, I have to run it in highest power setting or so called Virat mode all the time, I don't notice the difference in spends vs my old AC. Probably it is good for room size of 120 sq ft or less. Not impressed.
I think a Carrier or Blue star would be a better option.
I am now buying a fixed speed Windows AC from Carrier for my bedroom. Avoid Inverter ACs wherever you can.","Jun, 2024",2,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Air Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE1, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

33,This product is not supported in the LG ThinQ app for smart diagnosis,"The smart features are oversold. LG's way of performing smart diagnosis is by using an audiomessage from the AC which is decoded on your phone. BUT THIS FEATURE ALSO ISNT APPLICABLE ON THIS AC.

The AC has the logo for smart diagnosis but it doesn't work.

The cooling worked in Bangalore heat for one day. Now it only reduces the humidity of my room but doesn't cool anything. Room temperature is still showing up at 30 degrees.

The remote does not have a backlight.
The AC doesn't close the intake valve when the power goes, it will only do that if the power is available. How hard was it to put a single battery that could have just done that as a fail safe?

The gas must have leaked during installation. The installation people aren't even bothering to look into my complaints. I can't even diagnose this AC myself, what rubbish in this age of smart technology! Do not buy this piece of rubbish.

UPDATE: So while my room is 250 sq ft, I can run this AC in the Viraat mode. It's effective that way. But it's still not worth the false advertising from LG.

41,AC with the least cooling efficiency.,"This AC is very poor in context of cooling. Everyone on the internet and other places will tell you that this company is good AC. But I will tell you that this particular AC is the worst at cooling. My cooler is cooling more in comparison with this LG AC.

Plus, this AC is ineffective and inefficient at cooling the whole room. Only through the way the air is blowing, you feel cool, which will also be very low.

If you have a complaint regarding the cooling of the product, you will have multiple service engineers visit, they will just check the grill temperature and measure the ampere and will tell you that device is good, even though this Machine is completely failure, they will also tell that this AC is not cooling properly. But you can't do anything.
At last, you will feel that all your hard-earned money is gone in the trash. Because if you run this machine, only your electricity bill will increase, but in response to that, the cooling is nonsense.
I have complained multiple times. The service engineers are all inexperienced and of no use.

Also, by gods grace I understood how pathetic the LG service is. Copper pipe is missed in my LG AC which I received from Amazon and Installation member has come and checked and said Copper pipe is missed and he suggested to use from him and the amount need to paid by me, but surprisingly LG authorized service (Rama Enterprises, Pune) center guys are selling the Whirlpool copper pipe and they dont have LG copper pipe and upon checking with LG customer support, they said, dont allow to use any other branded pipe else you would lose the warranty. So what should one do, if LG authorized dealer is not maintaining their own branded spares, which is very funny. What if some repair has to be done in future and no spare is available at company authorized service center itself. Better to avoid such brands as there is no use other than wasting our money on their useless products.

43,Worst experience in terms of servicing and quality,"Play Video
I have bought this LG only few months back. Since last 2 months I'm facing terrible issues and no technician is able to fix it.
1.Cooling issue: it's not cooling as per expectation. In my other room, I'm using marq cheap one ac which is working and cooling fine since 5 years.
2. Ch38 error: it keeps showing after sometime. Technician visits and refill the gas but not able to identify any leak. Now they have suggested no leak is there, you have to keep turning it on and off so that the error goes for sometime. This kind of resolution i dint expect from such populated brand.
Still now we are facing these 2 issue. It's been 2 months. As they couldn't able find any solution, they have stopped visiting now. And kept closing my complaints without any concerns.
My AC is still in warranty period. I asked since you are not able to fix then replace it. No body is responding..nobody is picking up the contacts customer care is sharing.
I am stuck with this 45k AC.

54,Crappy service and didn't work,"I bought this AC for my kids' bedroom with high expectations. The wall unit made a rattling sound during installation , and the technician who installed had to call someone else to figure it out.

The AC lay unused for the next ten days as kids went on vacation. When they came back, we found it doesn't cool at all...probably a gas leak due to poor fitting. That is where my troubles began...the LG website doesn't even give you an sms or email confirmation of the ticket you've registered.

The technician who called up next day told me it's not his problem, and I should contact the technician who originally installed it. I did not anticipate I'd have to do this chasing around for a simple service request.

(WE have been Samsung customers for last 20 years mainly because of their service network, and we were under the impression that LG is at par. BIG MISTAKE).
The AC was delivered promptly and we received a call the very next day. Two guys turned up, insisted that the outside unit has to be kept on the terrace (about 6000 rupees extra for copper wire). This was for my parents home, and they live closeby so we went over immediately to see. After pointing out that all ACs unit in that society were installed in the balcony (just 900 odd rupees for the bracket) they quickly lost interest and left to apparently buy the bracket. They were absconding, leaving the AC open in the bedroom. We reached out to the agencies (Top One Services and Jeeves, I don't know if they are the same, but both were in touch for installation.) They sent another guy. He came up with the same suggestion of the terrace and yelled at my parents when they said no. After that another guy came and said he will bring the bracket - went absconding again. During this time, we were calling Amazon as well as LG continuously to escalate. After 4 days the LG customer service person says they have NO RECORD of my half a dozen calls while Amazon says LG will handle this in 2 days.

LG Electronics - I used to trust LG products for their longevity - Our First TV from LG is still working for 20 years

- We bought an LG TV a few months before and it stopped working they said it was due to the PCB board fault and I had to wait for a few months to get it repaired and fixed/replaced.

- Around the same time we bought an LG1.5-ton AC and yesterday it stopped working throwing some error code - After two service technicians visited - Now they said - the PCB board was faulty and I needed to wait a few months - as they had to send an email and get approval to replace it

My money is stuck in their refund process and they are not releasing it to me. They are fraud. Please don't buy LG.
Also my old AC needs repairs and they said one month ago they need some parts and ordered the parts. It's just over a month now and they are still saying they didn't receive the parts. So my old AC is not repaired either. They are not able to fix their ACs. There is something terribly wrong with this company.

68,Absolute Nightmare - LG Air Conditioning Unit is Pure Trash,"The LG air conditioning unit I received was an absolute nightmare from the moment I unpacked it. Let me share my terrible experience so that others can avoid making the same mistake. I have never been more disappointed with a purchase in my entire life.

The unit was dead on arrival. The unit never worked. Either Amazon or LG don't want to take the accountability and refund or arrange a return. Amazon customer service just keeps transferring the calls / chats to multiple departments and eventually disconnects the calls. LG kept saying they'll fix the unit for the last 3 months with no one turning up. My 50000 for this unit is a dead investment.

It's mind-boggling how a supposedly reputable brand like LG could manufacture such a faulty and shoddy product. Furthermore, the unit's remote control was an absolute joke.

Last but not least, the customer support from LG was abysmal. I reached out to them multiple times to address these issues, but they provided zero assistance. It was like talking to a brick wall. They were unresponsive, indifferent, and showed no willingness to resolve the problems I encountered with their defective unit.

In conclusion, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and steer clear of this LG air conditioning unit. It's an absolute piece of junk that fails to deliver even the most basic functionality. Don't be fooled by the brand name; this product is a disgrace. Spare yourself the headache and invest in a more reliable and reputable air conditioner from a different manufacturer.

97,Disappointed with Product performance,"I am disappointed with the performance of the air conditioner I purchased. While the product delivery and installation process were hassle-free, the air conditioner itself is not functioning properly. It frequently shuts down unexpectedly and fails to provide adequate cooling.

In my attempt to seek assistance, I reached out to the brand's customer service, and they promptly sent an engineer to assess the issue. The engineer determined that the air conditioner has low coolant pressure, which is likely causing the malfunction. This leaves me unsure as to who is at fault for this situation: whether Amazon sent me a faulty product, or if the installation process was not carried out correctly.

Overall, while the delivery and installation experience were satisfactory, the ongoing performance issues with the air conditioner have left me disappointed.","May, 2023",2,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Air Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE1, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

100,"Service center using fake gas & local copper pipe, overcharging, customer care is helpless","Using Fake gas & copper pipe:
The service center (Royal Services Goa) used local copper pipes, several leftover pieces of insulation (instead of one continuous roll), and it seems they filled the AC with fake gas. AC was using full power but not cooling at all, the inside room temperature was higher than outside temperature & they were knowingly reporting wrong gas pressures to LG to cover up. I sent the pictures of the correct gas pressure to LG but the ASM took no action & service center stopped providing service and then closed the complaint. The installation technician also showed me samples of poor-quality copper pipes which he admitted were not from LG but from the local shop.

Overcharging & Arm twisting:
Service center said official company rates are for showing only. If I wanted officially published rates, the installation will not happen. That is exactly what they did. They kept me waiting for 10 days and then closed the complaint with reason ""customer does not want installation"" even though the matter was under escalation to with CEO's e-mail address.

Excess charges:
Extra Copper Pipe with insulation & vinyl tape: Official Rate 850/meter, Service center wanted: 1130 + gst
Power chord: Official Rate 60/meter, Service center wanted 180/meter
Gas refilling charge on brand new installation: Official rate: Free, its included, Service center wanted: 1500 + GST

Even after the matter was raised with the Area Service Manager (ASM), the ASM instead of upholding official rates said its not profitable for the service center & wanted me to directly negotiate unofficial rates with the service center.

AC not installed in 10 days:
Since I insisted on official installation prices, the service center stopped responding to calls or messages. The matter was escalated to the ASM but nothing changed.

Useless customer care:
The matter was escalated using the write to CEO link. This turned to be a total waste of time as you only get directed to customer care and get generic responses. They forwarded my complaint to the persons against whom the complaint was made. No one from LG customer care even called to find out whats going on & the harassment only increased. Amazon also escalated the issue at their end but the installation was not done in 10 days. Finally, I gave up and returned the AC.

114,May work better for smaller rooms,"I bought this AC in May 2024 and have been using it for couple of weeks now. Earlier I had a 10 yrs old 1.5 ton fixed speed Carrier AC, deployed in my living room/kitchen area with a size of approx 150 sq ft and it would chill the room. This LG AC is able to moderate the temperature to some extent but the air flow is barely noticeable even in HC mode, till the time I am sitting in front of it. This AC does not justify the steep cost!
Since, I have to run it in highest power setting or so called Virat mode all the time, I don't notice the difference in spends vs my old AC. Probably it is good for room size of 120 sq ft or less. Not impressed.
I think a Carrier or Blue star would be a better option.

133,This product is not supported in the LG ThinQ app for smart diagnosis,"The smart features are oversold. LG's way of performing smart diagnosis is by using an audiomessage from the AC which is decoded on your phone. BUT THIS FEATURE ALSO ISNT APPLICABLE ON THIS AC.

The AC has the logo for smart diagnosis but it doesn't work.

The cooling worked in Bangalore heat for one day. Now it only reduces the humidity of my room but doesn't cool anything. Room temperature is still showing up at 30 degrees.

The remote does not have a backlight.
The AC doesn't close the intake valve when the power goes, it will only do that if the power is available. How hard was it to put a single battery that could have just done that as a fail safe?

The gas must have leaked during installation. The installation people aren't even bothering to look into my complaints. I can't even diagnose this AC myself, what rubbish in this age of smart technology! Do not buy this piece of rubbish.

UPDATE: So while my room is 250 sq ft, I can run this AC in the Viraat mode. It's effective that way. But it's still not worth the false advertising from LG.

141,AC with the least cooling efficiency.,"This AC is very poor in context of cooling. Everyone on the internet and other places will tell you that this company is good AC. But I will tell you that this particular AC is the worst at cooling. My cooler is cooling more in comparison with this LG AC.

Plus, this AC is ineffective and inefficient at cooling the whole room. Only through the way the air is blowing, you feel cool, which will also be very low.

If you have a complaint regarding the cooling of the product, you will have multiple service engineers visit, they will just check the grill temperature and measure the ampere and will tell you that device is good, even though this Machine is completely failure, they will also tell that this AC is not cooling properly. But you can't do anything.
At last, you will feel that all your hard-earned money is gone in the trash. Because if you run this machine, only your electricity bill will increase, but in response to that, the cooling is nonsense.

Also, by gods grace I understood how pathetic the LG service is. Copper pipe is missed in my LG AC which I received from Amazon and Installation member has come and checked and said Copper pipe is missed and he suggested to use from him and the amount need to paid by me, but surprisingly LG authorized service (Rama Enterprises, Pune) center guys are selling the Whirlpool copper pipe and they dont have LG copper pipe and upon checking with LG customer support, they said, dont allow to use any other branded pipe else you would lose the warranty. So what should one do, if LG authorized dealer is not maintaining their own branded spares, which is very funny. What if some repair has to be done in future and no spare is available at company authorized service center itself. Better to avoid such brands as there is no use other than wasting our money on their useless products.

I have bought this LG only few months back. Since last 2 months I'm facing terrible issues and no technician is able to fix it.
1.Cooling issue: it's not cooling as per expectation. In my other room, I'm using marq cheap one ac which is working and cooling fine since 5 years.
2. Ch38 error: it keeps showing after sometime. Technician visits and refill the gas but not able to identify any leak. Now they have suggested no leak is there, you have to keep turning it on and off so that the error goes for sometime. This kind of resolution i dint expect from such populated brand.
Still now we are facing these 2 issue. It's been 2 months. As they couldn't able find any solution, they have stopped visiting now. And kept closing my complaints without any concerns.
My AC is still in warranty period. I asked since you are not able to fix then replace it. No body is responding..nobody is picking up the contacts customer care is sharing.
I am stuck with this 45k AC.
Please don't go for it for the sake of brand name.

The technician who called up next day told me it's not his problem, and I should contact the technician who originally installed it. I did not anticipate I'd have to do this chasing around for a simple service request.

(WE have been Samsung customers for last 20 years mainly because of their service network, and we were under the impression that LG is at par. BIG MISTAKE).
The AC was delivered promptly and we received a call the very next day. Two guys turned up, insisted that the outside unit has to be kept on the terrace (about 6000 rupees extra for copper wire). This was for my parents home, and they live closeby so we went over immediately to see. After pointing out that all ACs unit in that society were installed in the balcony (just 900 odd rupees for the bracket) they quickly lost interest and left to apparently buy the bracket. They were absconding, leaving the AC open in the bedroom. We reached out to the agencies (Top One Services and Jeeves, I don't know if they are the same, but both were in touch for installation.) They sent another guy. He came up with the same suggestion of the terrace and yelled at my parents when they said no. After that another guy came and said he will bring the bracket - went absconding again. During this time, we were calling Amazon as well as LG continuously to escalate. After 4 days the LG customer service person says they have NO RECORD of my half a dozen calls while Amazon says LG will handle this in 2 days.

- Around the same time we bought an LG1.5-ton AC and yesterday it stopped working throwing some error code - After two service technicians visited - Now they said - the PCB board was faulty and I needed to wait a few months - as they had to send an email and get approval to replace it

Let me share my terrible experience so that others can avoid making the same mistake. I have never been more disappointed with a purchase in my entire life.

The unit was dead on arrival. The unit never worked. Either Amazon or LG don't want to take the accountability and refund or arrange a return. Amazon customer service just keeps transferring the calls / chats to multiple departments and eventually disconnects the calls. LG kept saying they'll fix the unit for the last 3 months with no one turning up. My 50000 for this unit is a dead investment.

It's mind-boggling how a supposedly reputable brand like LG could manufacture such a faulty and shoddy product. Furthermore, the unit's remote control was an absolute joke.

Last but not least, the customer support from LG was abysmal. I reached out to them multiple times to address these issues, but they provided zero assistance. It was like talking to a brick wall. They were unresponsive, indifferent, and showed no willingness to resolve the problems I encountered with their defective unit.

In conclusion, save yourself the time, money, and frustration and steer clear of this LG air conditioning unit. It's an absolute piece of junk that fails to deliver even the most basic functionality. Don't be fooled by the brand name; this product is a disgrace. Spare yourself the headache and invest in a more reliable and reputable air conditioner from a different manufacturer.

They returned without fixing it. Perhaps the issue is bigger and they didn't have an immediate solution. Complaint is still pending. So worried.

It frequently shuts down unexpectedly and fails to provide adequate cooling.

In my attempt to seek assistance, I reached out to the brand's customer service, and they promptly sent an engineer to assess the issue. The engineer determined that the air conditioner has low coolant pressure, which is likely causing the malfunction. This leaves me unsure as to who is at fault for this situation: whether Amazon sent me a faulty product, or if the installation process was not carried out correctly.

Overall, while the delivery and installation experience were satisfactory, the ongoing performance issues with the air conditioner have left me disappointed.","May, 2023",2,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q19YNZE, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

200,Dont Buy this AC: My experience in 1 month,"I recently purchased the LG Air Conditioner dual inverter AC, and it has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. Here's why I wouldn't recommend this product:
1. Poor Cooling Performance: Despite the high price and impressive specifications, this air conditioner barely cools the room. Even at the lowest temperature setting, it struggles to make a noticeable difference, especially on hotter days.
2. Energy Inefficiency: My electricity bill skyrocketed after using this air conditioner for just one month. It consumes an excessive amount of power, which is both environmentally unfriendly and expensive.
3. Unreliable Performance: The air conditioner frequently stops working without warning. I've had to reset it multiple times, and customer service has been unhelpful in resolving these issues. It's clear that there are significant reliability problems with this model.
4. Poor Customer Service: Speaking of customer service, my interactions with the company have been frustrating. Long wait times, unhelpful representatives, and no satisfactory solutions to my issues. It’s been a nightmare trying to get any support or assistance.
5. In summary, the LG Air Conditioner dual inverter AC Air Conditioner has been a major letdown in every aspect. From its poor cooling capabilities and excessive noise to its high energy consumption and unreliable performance, I regret purchasing this product. Save your money and look for a more reliable and efficient air conditioner.

203,Product is Good. Installation experience was very bad.,"Bought this product from HSR Layout, Bengaluru.

Delivery (Amazon Executive) :
Very good, very professional.

Installation (LG Technician):
Highly unprofessional, rude, lacks technical knowledge and common sense.
They have absolutely no idea about indoor electrical pipes or any aesthetics of final fittings.
They were fitting the indoor unit leaving only 4 inches (approx 8 to 10 cm) space from ceiling, whereas it is clearly written that a minimum gap of 20 cm needs to be left from the ceiling while fitting the indoor unit.
They do not use the circular cup drill for the large wall hole, they use the small drill bit and make multiple holes and then use a hammer and chisel to make a larger than required hole, significantly damaging the wall more than required.
They do not vaccum the system before opening the gas, after fitting the outdoor unit.
The outdoor unit was installed slanting, not straight.
No product demo was given. The technician didn't know how to use the remote not did he know about multiple functions and modes.
AC was not run on test mode for 18 mins either.
I had to learn myself from YouTube.
Installation technician was rude and threatened to not do the work when we tried to correct him.

Product performance:
Been using this product for 3 days now, it's fairly good, cools a 170 sqfeet room from 32 C in 5 to 10 mins in the VIRAT mode.
The AC is very very quiet, and sustained cooling at 24 C is pretty good.
A silent sleek fast cooling AC with a lot of features for optimum comfort and energy efficiency.

Additional costs:
Installation fees ₹1414
Brackets ₹870
PVC vinyl tape ₹300
White cement ₹50
3 PIN Plug 15 Amps ₹100
Additional charges for additional copper pipe and outlet pipe(if needed)

Final thoughts - The performance and efficiency and longevity of an air conditioner solely depends on how well it has been installed. AC installation is a highly technical process, and LG has done a major cost cutting when it comes the installation technician .

Will recommend to get the Blue star AC or something else from a nearby dealership like Relaince , which has much more professional installation.","Mar, 2024",2,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 2 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q18JNXE3, White",LG 1.5 Ton 3 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC
204,Would not recommend buying this,"Performance of AC is good but giving 3 stars because of Remote and installation experience. Remote is not illuminated and don’t have backlight for the display. It is difficult to find or use during night time. This being non WIFI model, LG should have provided this basic option.

Regards to installation, had a horrible experience. First of all the installation happened only after 5 days of delivery that too after escalation to LG. The service person did not even had basic items like insulation tape or hacksaw blade and asking us to provide. They charged 150 rupees additional to use a bag while drilling the wall so that the debris fall into the bag and the room stays clean but all the debris fell into the room and when requested to remove they said it is not their duty but charged 150 rupees to use a bag to keep the room clean which is useless. I would not recommend this product just for the above reasons rather go for Indian companies that gives product with value for money and good customer experience.","Mar, 2024",3,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 2 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q18JNXE3, White",LG 1.5 Ton 3 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

206,Detailed Review of My Poor Experience with Delivery and Installation Services(SCAM ALERT),"I strongly recommend reading this review before making a purchase. I've never written a negative review before, but this experience compelled me to share.

Delivery:

The delivery service from Amazon was extremely disappointing. As I was traveling internationally, my 68-year-old father assisted the delivery personnel. Despite providing clear instructions for the delivery address, the delivery person was rude upon arrival. My father requested that the AC unit be placed on the first floor. The delivery person outright refused, stating, ""It wasn't mentioned to place it on the first floor. You can move it yourself. We won't do it,"" and left.

Expecting a senior citizen to carry an AC unit to the first floor without assistance is unacceptable. The delivery terms stated that two delivery personnel would place the AC where instructed. Currently, the AC is still lying outside our garage where they left it.

Installation:

I purchased this AC because my wife is pregnant and we wanted a comfortable environment for her in India. Despite this urgent need, it has been over six days without any contact from the brand for installation.

I've contacted LG customer care multiple times over the past three days. Each time, I was told, ""The service center has confirmed the AC will be installed today. You'll receive a call shortly."" However, I never received any such call. My frustration with the customer service representatives was met with vague assurances, making it clear they either lack the necessary personnel or are running a scam.

Why Scam?

My nephew ordered the same AC model with a 3-star configuration on the same day as mine. He also received no contact from the installation team. After five days, he resorted to a local vendor for installation. Immediately after the installation was completed, he received a call from the brand’s engineer. When my nephew explained the situation, the engineer threatened to void the warranty since the installation wasn't done by them. To preserve the warranty, he had to pay the engineer INR 1400 to mark the installation as complete.

This practice seems like a scheme to make money without effort, especially by frustrating elderly customers.

Given the poor installation service, I doubt the warranty is even worth having, as they are unlikely to honor it.

Due to this ongoing disappointment, I am returning this AC. I strongly advise anyone in urgent need of an AC to contact local vendors rather than purchasing online.

217,Very bad experience,"It's being a month only I have purchased this AC though this website,the experience was pathetic till date.
2 people came for installation,but the great part was to they are not from the company they are from some third party who was there for warrenty. They installed the AC,from the next day the entire pipe line even the AC was leaking. There was a water leakage everywhere. We made a complaint on the brand support and they are arguing with us only and bleaming us that why we have done the installation from third party but the same has been sent from you guys.

Then someone came again from third party and mentioned so many things like, the installation was not properly done, the pipe quality was bad and many more stuff.

My brother contacted the third party manager and that person was showing like he was giving us a favor for listening us .
We had to explain the entire story every time to every individual.
There was a extend warranty and someone came to check the AC and just for visiting he charged, but the product was still in warranty.

220,My overall experience is good,"Here is my review of this product that will help you decide this ac
1. My installation was perfect and guys are also good.
2. Cooling is good. I cant say it super-chills the room in a 10 minutes. This is subjective things. It depends on the wall and insulation and size of the room. If you have one floor building and there is direct sunlight on the room then it will take time. It will be better if you run the ac on viraat mode for 30 minutes and then switch to lower convertible mode.
3. Ac is really very silent. You will hear blower sound if ac is running on full capacity (Viraat Mode)
4. Look is premium
5. Electricity consumption is also subjective thing. It depends on the room and cooling.

Biggest cons
The biggest cons of this ac down flap.

227,Worst AC anyone could buy..,"I am writing this review after using for 1 month. I have using LG AC in my previous apartment for the past 9 years. As I did not face much issue I blindly bought LG 1.5 ton ac for my new home. On the day of installation, I told the installation person that the ac is not cooling much. He asked me to wait for a day as it is a new ac and inverter acs take some time to cool the room. I was in a dilemma if there something wrong with the model I have selected or weather is too hot outside which was causing the cooling issue. I bought Lloyd for another room a week back, which is also 1.5 ton and to my surprise it cooled the room in 2 minutes. Then I realised it is the issue with LG AC and raised customer support request. Service person came and said that I will have to clean the filter of ac every week to make the ac work. I was so frustrated and asked him to clean and see if the ac works as expected. He cleaned it and put the ac on 16 degrees and waited for 15 minutes and room temperature was still 26.. he started saying that because it is summer and temperature is high outside it is not cooling. I took him to the other room and showed how the other ac is working. He did not fix anything or suggested anything and went away.

Problem start post Installation. I logged call for engineer site visits. After calling customer care 4-5 times for the status of my call logged, everytime I got assurance that engineer will connect me shortly which never Happened. I got surprised that after 15-20 days of continues follow-up, my service request was closed without my knowledge. They people not even bothered to at least connect me before closing my request.

235,Issues with my two LG branded AC purchased recently.,"From my experience I would suggest not to go for LG barnded ACs. One month back I bought LG 1.5 Ton 3 . Star AI DUAL Inverter Split AC. After 5 days of delivery engineer came and installed and gave demo and left, after 30min from the indoor unti water started dropping even though it was cooling the room. I called the same engineer he did not come so next day I raised one complain. The service negineer came and said sir chassis need to be changed which may take 2-3days based on availability of equipment. After lots of followup after 11days they they came with chassis and checked again and said sir its not chassis rather cooling compartment needed to chang. Again i waited for around 12days. Every time I call customer care they will say we will send a esclation mail, at last they gave one number and asked me to speak. That person is saying sir PO has been raised material has to reach. In the mean while now AC is not cooling anymore. By the time I am writing this I am still waiting to get this repaired.
Just to add on in month Jan 2023 I bought another LG 5 star dual inverter AC as well for my other house, but that was offline. That was installed by LG engineer but after around 40days of installation it stopped cooling. When I raised complain the engineer came and did high level inspection and told while installation they might have done something wrong. After 2days again they came and checked by opening and said no sir installation is ok but gas is not there when I asked if installation is OK then how gas leak happened he said some story like sir it is very hot and humid outsied sometimes it happens. I was really surprised to here.
So out of these two LG AC experience I would suggest better go for other better brand though I can not suggest which brand as I am not an expert.
But one suggestion if you are purchasing LG brand then do installation by their engineer else they will put all problem on those guys and deny for providing free solution within the warranty period.","May, 2023",1,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 2 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q18JNXE3, White",LG 1.5 Ton 3 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

i had to call, write, and attend multiple calls daily to get work done.

However, finally, they opened ODU and fixed it, I ended up getting a faulty product that can stop working anytime, despite paying the best.

B: Copper pipe 170 rs / feet = 850 rs

3.Performing proper vacum for faster cooling & better performance
4.Better look,proper laying of insulation to connecting tubes
5.Vinyl tapping on piping
6.Hole properly closed with White cement / POP - No Insect entry / rat bite

What they have done is
1. Vaccum was not done
2.holes were not sealed
3.taping was not proper.
4. Rubber bushes were not placed between the outdoor unit and ac stand which I bought from them. (Rubber bushes are sleeping on my drawer - may be it's not needed but why should company provides that)

Totally not a value for money.

I am not sure, why Amazon is hosting products like this and vendors who cheat customers. I am so regretful about this.

First Amazon forgets to ship the essential part of this AC, which is also tagged to be shipped together with this, the 4 mm copper pipe, and when installation team came for setting up the AC, they charged me extra for that pipe, when I called Amazon, they declined to give any support or send the missing components, they gave me a terrible gift voucher, which I never redeemed.

When I call Amazon customer care, they ask to call product care, when I call LG service center they ask to call local repair, when the local repairer comes they do not pay attention to solving the problem, and leave. And then the cycle repeats.

Now, the AC is completely broken, I have had more than six services and two repair sessions on this from LG repairers, but the problem persists.

267,Not satisfied,"I bought it 2months ago and it was delivered and installed like super fast.
If I talk about cooling it’s not effective at all. You can run it all night long on Virat mode and the temperature if the room (10x12x10) drops just 2degrees.

Also, the indoor unit seems like it’s 1ton as it is shorter than the normal 1.5tons indoor units. I clarified with service people who installed it but they said it’s not written in the unit and they installed.

It’s waste of money for me.","May, 2024",1,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 2 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q18JNXE3, White",LG 1.5 Ton 3 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC
268,LG selling lies. But Amazon is simply awesome.,"Choosing the right capacity is most crucial when buying an air conditioner. But these brands cheat you with their deceptive marketing.

Shame.

This unit is rated at 4400 wats (1.25 Tons) and LG is shamelessly selling this as 1.5 Ton.

Also you get a smart wifi enabled AC at this price point.

The star here is for amazon. Buying on amazon is such a peace of mind. The product was delivered to me and then after reading the specs on the box i decided that this ac will be insufficient for my room.

I requested amazon for a return. They processed the return and refund smoothly.

Three Cheers for Amazon. Such customer service makes Amazon my first choice of buying anything. From small accessories to big purchases.

This is 1.2 ton AC and not 1.5 ton. This very small in the compared to other brands at 37.5K
Also during delivery , the copper wires and nuts were missing, which costed another 3.6K which should come as part of the LG package. Technician mentioned delivery people carefully remove the copper wire and without hampering the box

271,"AC of no use at all, never buy LG AC, you will be definitely disappointed","LG has failed to produce a minimum basic feature product. In the current competition world, LG like company is producing a product that is of no use.

1. We ordered this 1.5 ton AC because of room size(10X12). Its a very tiny one that produces big noise, I am thinking like I brought a tower fan

2. As this AC is very small size, it is fitted in some part of the room, actual problem starts from here. It doesn't have horizontal swing.

3. Worst design for indoor unit and its air flow, air flows only upwards

4. Remote has lot of buttons with no background light, while you are sleeping and want to change the something then you can't as you need to switch on the light and that will disturb everyone.

However, since deployment, A/C has not been able to provide effective cooling despite installed in room that is much smaller than other rooms where 2 Daikin A/Cs (also 1.5 Ton 3 Star) are installed.

300,Beware before you purchase,"I am a loyal LG Customer and never faced any problem with their product. Their customer service has also been excellent throughout all these years. But this is the first time that I have faced an issue of manufacturing defect with LG AC. The AC was installed by the rookie technicians who did not check any leakage in the AC, perhaps assuming the brand reputation. Later, when I switched on the AC, it did not give any cooling. When I contacted customer care, the technicians visited and they checked that the gas had leaked. They checked the indoor and outdoor unit and even filled it with nitrogen gas to check for leakage. But as there was no leakage, they put new gas went away. Later, again the gas got leaked in three days. After that, today, again after raising the complaint, a specialist technician came and he saw that the cooling coil of the AC was damaged and the gas was leaking from that part. Earlier, all the technicians kept blaming our internal pipes at home for the leaks.
This technician told me that these 2023 models are reporting this issue of cooling coil leakages since the last two months. Fortunately, the product is under warranty and it would be replaced free of cost, otherwise since LG has started outsourcing the manufacturing of their products to local manufacturers, there are problems in the products.

In case you have also purchased any of the 2023 models, irrespective of features and weight, and you face a similar issue, tell the technician to check the cooling coil because these models are reporting this problem. I had to write this in review so that any buyer who is facing this issue would know the real issue behind the leakage.

UPDATE - LG recommended replacement of the product due to multiple leakages and Amazon turned it into a nightmare for me. It is not giving me the complete installation charges and even telling me that it can pay a small share of it only as an Amazon Pay GiftCard. Please do not buy any electronic product from Amazon because they will make it a nightmare for you. Buy from the local dealer. I have complained against Amazon to the National Consumer Helpline (INGRAMS).

305,High additional installation charges from the brand,"Although the product has been functioning well so far( it's been 2 days since the purchase).

Couple of concerns that happened with this product which has been unlike my typical Amazon experience.

A. The exchange value of the item will be determined by an independent agency at the time of pickup, therefore despite qualifying the criterias indicated in the checklist, it is subject to change, which was our experience - additionally unfortunately the pick up agent took extra charges from us. The customer care has raised the issue- and trying to resolve this.

2. The installation charges- it can be additional and go upto 5200. The LG service agent claimed that this is for additional copperwires and other materials deemed necessary by the engineer after inspection of the location and that this is standard across the country irrespective of the platform you purchase from.

I wish I had known that this could be the extent of additional charges I could potentially incur.

310,Decided not to go for LG products and not to buy appliances online..,"***Beware of LG!***
I decided not to go for LG products for the rest of my life.

Bought this AC and the Brand installed it on 2nd of June. Product stopped working the next day!

Contacted the person on 3rd june, who installed the product and waited for them to visit and check, but there was no response from them further.

So i Registered a service request with LG on 4th where they mentioned it'll be attended in 72Hrs.. and waited politely for a day and when i checked with them on 5th, they replied that there was no request registered!! Was shocked to know that and i wanted to raise a request again on 5th. Till then there were no messages/ acknowledgements from LG support that a service request is raised.

I started following up with them 10 times a day about the status,(to make sure the request exists) where i was strictly told that it will take upto 72 hours and i literally begged with them to make it quick.

It is 8th of June today.. and when i called them today they said they cancelled my request. Reason they came up with is that there was an existing request for demo installation that was not closed. Does that make any sense.. Don't they know this when they accepted the request on 5th.

Tricky part is that they told me that they have raised a new request again today and guess what, i will have to wait for another 72 hours. Note that they didn't care about the pending demo request that was the reason for request cancellation and they have booked a new request now. Asked them if they are going to play the same game once again after 72 hours and they had no answers.

Coming to Amazon support, when i checked with them, they sounded like they don't have any grip on this and all they can do is raise a request with LG on our behalf and we will have to deal with LG.

It's 8th day and i'm literally begging and fighting with LG and Amazon all these days, but no one came to help so far.

Main problem is with LG service and installation. They give third party to install and the installation guy was very unprofessional. He didn't ask where u want to fit AC they do work as per their convenience. Won't recommend LG service. We pay extra for brand because of their services and sales support but LG has very poor services so I recommend to with other brand and save your money. Disappointment from LG.

312,Disappointing Customer Support Experience by LG,"It's a great product with multiple modes of operation. AC is very silent in operation and is a perfect choice for a 100 sqft room ( Its 1 ton with 5* rating). Have a great admiration about the quality of LG products as I am using the same brand's Washing machine and Micrwave Oven.

The disappointing matter is about the after sales service. The AC got delivered on 27th March 2024, and since the technician didn't reported till 30th March 2024 ( after three days of delivery) I called Amazon customer service and reported the matter. Following this I recieved a call from the service partner of LG and informed that installation is scheduled on 1st April. Since the technican failed to turnup on 1st I called LG customer support and requested for an escalation of the complaint.

And finally on 2nd April Afternnon the technican came. A positive attitude and careful handling of the equipment at par with the reputation of the brand was expected from the service personnel but was infomed by my family that it was quite disappointing. It may be because of the escalation of the complaint and such a behaviour is completely unacceptable, from the customer point of view. LG disappointed us in providing a decent installation service and I am also concerned about the periodic service of the equipment by such technicians.","Apr, 2024",2,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q13JNYE, White",LG 1 Ton 4 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

317,"DONT BUY OTHERWISE YOU WILL REGRET LATER - Wrong Built,It attracts dust,Water leaks inside.","I did a big mistake by ordering this LG AC. Please read the complete comment before going for this bug model AC. The feedback is after using it three months.
Worst Cooling:
This AC won't cool even though you keep it in 19 or 18.
Bought this AC in Mid-April (2023) and by first (Or Max second) month itself ,the cooling was not proper and we found some problem.

Wrong Built - Model:
The built of this AC itself is weird and I personally feel it is not suitable for the houses where there are no young/Mid aged ones around.
Reason being, every 10 days, you need to clean the filter of this AC which will be right at top.
It will be difficult as I ordered for my old parents and every time they must find someone to clean this by using ladder or something.
If you don't clean this filter, the AC wont cool.
Interestingly, this point was not mentioned in our demo, and we came to know about this once we raised a complaint about cooling issues the very next week after buying this one.
Service technician-Useless:
The service technician came as we raised a complaint for cooling related issue.
He created a new issue after the service, Water started leaking inside the room.(Refer the attached video).
AC attracts dust more than customers:
Refer the images no need to explain. Its just after 3 months usage and having a filter on top which is to avoid the dust but still lot of dust and every 2 months you have to call service guy.
In short: EVERY TWO MONTHS YOU HAVE TO CONTACT SERVICE WHICH IS ALSO USELESS.
FIRST THREE or FOUR ARE ONLY FREE.
Waste Training demo by LG.
Remote have lot of options (which god only knows) but what is the point when it is failing the basic thing which is to cool the room.

If possible, I will replace this by Carrier as we used it earlier and it is far far better than this LG..
Also, I am sure that all the ratings in social media by Youtube, Insta influencers are paid.

DONT BUY OTHERWISE YOU WILL REGRET LATER.

Hence i talk to LG care for the same cooling issue. Technician came and checked. No issue was found. Technician suggested, its cooling can't be improved as this machine is only made for such Very low level cooling. Market gimmicks are made to lure customers. I Suggest, don't buy LG products.

320,Good Product but Installation is very costly,"1) Product is good
2) No light in remote, difficult to use in night.
3) VERY HIGH INSTALLATION CHARGES. LG has assigned a third party vendor to do installation. They will charge almost double the amount for installation. For 7 feet extra pipe, they charged me almost Rs 5000, local AC technician had quoted approximately Rs 2500. The problem is your will not get warranty if it is installed by local technician. Secondly they will not give you bill post installation, you will have to ask them for Gst bill.","Nov, 2023",3,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q13JNYE, White",LG 1 Ton 4 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

Coming to a large org like LG, it's a disgrace they are yet to even add this model to even register in there application and smart diagnosis is a scam as you can't even add this variant in that damn LGthinQ app. So it's a lie when they say it supports smart diagnosis and we can't connect AC to wifi even.

326,Mistakes were made,"I bought this AC after checking the features and reading some reviews. I forgot to focus on after sales service feedbacks.
The AC which was installed was not cooling properly. So I raised a request and a service engineer visited. The engineer said that the installation was not done properly by the local LG team. He will raise this and get it fixed. And from here started the wait.
No one showed up for 3 days. I reached out to LG over whatsapp. The agent there raised a complaint but again no one showed up. I checked everyday but the WhatsApp agent would just apologize that they are deeply sorry and escalating.
And this is still going...

327,Don’t buy from Amazon,"The AC in good one. But the seller did not send cool paper pipe and installation kit which costs Rs. 4000. When I called Amazon, I was told that, Amazon will pay me back but after installation. When I shared the Job Sheet Amazon denied to pay for the installation kit(copper nut) which is of 400 rupees. So, I will suggest not buy from Amazon as the sellers here are not sending all components with the AC. Moreover, Amazon do not care about it and asks customers to pay from own pocket which is wrong. So be careful before you order from here.","Aug, 2024",1,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q13JNYE, White",LG 1 Ton 4 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

Finally, after 3days of delivery, visited the service center physically, took the allotted persons reachable number, constantly followed up and got it installed. The service engineers were in a hurry (understandable), and just installed the AC without filling the hole or covering the pipes with the insulation tapes (provided) fully. They also charged me 1400+300 extra because I bought AC stand from outside. I had hole in the wall and 16A plug beforehand.

This inconsistency not only defeats the purpose of the energy-saving mode but also disrupts the comfort of the indoor environment. It's incredibly frustrating to have the unit suddenly stop cooling when it's needed most, leading me to give it a rating of one star.

After six days of waiting, LG didn't respond for installation. Amazon also gave up and could not get LG install the AC. Eventually Amazon accepted the return request and AC has been picked up by Amazon for return.
That's LG for you. If you are still going for LG then be ready to learn from your own mistake.

The door cannot be closed now, and later we came to know that the wall can be drilled and there is no beam on it. These boys just want to complete the job and leave, and are least bothered about customer satisfaction. In the video, you can see that the other wall was completely destroyed by drilling and also there is an offset from the wall which makes it even more worse. What's more pathetic is that the boys were abusive all the time during installation and used cursing words about me on the phone, as he my ac installation was not as he expected it to be. I have raised complaint to LG customer care and yet to get a resolution.","Mar, 2024",1,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q13JNYE, White",LG 1 Ton 4 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

360,Installation,"Worse experience of installation of my AC by Suhana Service. My installation request was assigned to Suhana Service and installation was supposed to be completed after 72hrs of delivery as per policy. Almost 7 days passed and didn't receive any call from technician or service provider. I lodged multiple complaints to LG and also through Amazon but didn't workout. Tried to call to Service Provider by number which I got from LG customer care many a times but no one picked or called back.

My personal experience if installation request is assigned to Suhana Service immediately call LG customer care to change request to some other service provider.

Suggestion to LG immediately blacklist Suhana Service from your account to avoid such experience.","May, 2024",1,"Copper, AI Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Swing, HD Filter with Anti-Virus Protection, 2024 Model, TS-Q13JNYE, White",LG 1 Ton 4 Star DUAL Inverter Split AC

They did not had the vacuum machine and was suggesting that it is not required. They also didn't do the basic electrical setup to get my ac running. Instead they just tested my ac with a 2.5mm wire and was refusing to test it for a longer period. I had to call another electrician to power my ac.

They ended up drilling a very big hole and not filling it properly too. We had to spend time filling the area left by the service ppl. So in totality if someone is planning to buy this product go with the assumption that it will cost you almost 50K (MRP Says approx 40k.. you end up paying 6 to 7 k more) for mediocre service.

402,"Free installation, Service is a Myth","Hello All,
I just bought this product and got it installed during the Amazon great Indian sale. And I can provide you and honest feedback on this product and services.
I bought this product on 11th may got delivered on 12th may and installed don 13th may, pretty impressive uhh... No... The story now begins…I was told about the free installation in the product from the LG...but its not… when the LG technician came to my place ( Point to note) he started asking some items as part of installation
• Wall mount bracket
• Drain Pipe
• Wall wire holder ( White Plastic thing that holds wire or small pipes on wall)
• MCB switch (16 Amp) ( I had a power point separate for AC)
I said I do not have, I guess if these are part of installation they have to be inside the AC packing box or you might be carrying it. To which he said yes he is carrying but I need to pay for these as these are not part of installation (How can a wall bracket for outdoor unit not a part of installation). After sensing that I am not aware of what is required he quoted a price for me.
After he left, the AC started leaking from inside (indoor unit) from every inch. To which when I called this technician said is a temporary problem and may go by morning, If not he will come again.
When he came he said he may have to make the hole bigger he will again do some civil work, my entire room became a mess with dust and dirt after how he did. The wall are over with hand marks. He was very bad at keeping things clean and tidy.
He was not even carrying ladder which I arranged, in fact I was standing holding while the technician was working.
After the work was finished he did not even seal the Hole that he created, when I asked he said it will work, it’s not a problem, I guess I have to fill POP in that hole myself (Lot of work as again get ladder).

So in the nutshell, there is nothing called free , You have to shell out at least 2500 more from your pocket ( apart from installation) to keep everything neat and tidy.
I am keeping this a rating two for all the troubles that this product have given me, I should have bought cooler instead. I disliked the service from LG. I will recommend as the cooling is nice (but not sure as how long, it’s just two days), But make sure this is not the final amount, you may have to add at least around 2-2.5k additional.","May, 2017",2,"JS-Q12CPXD, White",LG 1 Ton 3 Star Inverter Split AC
403,Can't cool the room,This AC is useless. It is unable to cool a small room inspite of keeping it running for a few hours. I even called LG customer care and had them take a look at it and the technician's advise was for me to create a separate roof over the outside unit to keep the machine a few degrees cooler. I've never heard of doing such a thing to get an ac to perform like it should. The technicians also did a shoddy job of servicing the air conditioner. Barely cleaned it and were in a hurry to leave.

I am also having 1.5 tones another model of Dual inverter AC of LG makes installed that also make a lot of noise.

The warranty only covers for the Damaged parts, and if Cooling Gas leaks due to it or something else happens as a side effect of the damaged product. The company and whoever the 3rd party company who works on their behalf would charge hefty amounts to get it fixed + 750Rs (for even just dropping by to take a look).

Pros
Good iot features but app doesn't include all the features that the remote has like 80% 60% modes changes.
Cooling is just about okayish, nothing great here
Cons
Outdoor unit is making noise like a helicopter is going above the house. When in sleep mode indoor unit is so quiet, u can hear outdoor unit noise in room.
If u mount ac right above ur bed it will not be useful to u because its swing blade don't go lower like other acs go. U need atleast 7/8ft distance between ur bed and ac if u can to get ac fan air on ur bed
Unit consumption is just abt 0.8 to 1 unit an hour. If u use hc cool mode it will burn 2 units or more in an hour. Sleep mode uses 0.4 unit an hour when set to 26.

If u have a bigger room with direct sunlight coming onto the rooms roof then probably this ac is not for u
Buy any heavy duty ac.

482,Third grade service by LG technicians,I have not bought this AC from Amazon. 1 star rating is due to the service provided by LG. LG technicians who visited were rookies and clueless about installation. Despite the fact that I showed the two previously installed ACs they could not figure out how to drill the hole for drain pipe. They drilled half hole and realized the bottom part of hole could not be drilled because of the slab. Then they left and called the core cutting guy. The core cutting guy said core cutting is done horizontally not vertically. These LG technicians didn't know how core cutting is done !? After four hours of installation which didn't happen the technicians left the whole place in dust. Even though LG might have built a good AC it is worthless due to hassles in getting it installed. Shame on LG service.,"Mar, 2022",1,"Copper, Super Convertible 6-in-1 Cooling, 4 Way Swing, Anti Allergic Filter, 2022 Model, PS-Q19SWZF, White",LG 1.5 Ton 5 Star AI DUAL Inverter Wi-Fi Split AC

488,Not Satisfied with this LG product,"Play Video
It's a review post one month of using this product. I purchase it cause of many positive reviews on YouTube, but I really made a mistake here that I believe in what I didn't experience. This product interior is made up of plastic which makes it worst. And I get the crackling noise from the day it is installed. I complaint LG service centre, LG technician visited my place, re-assembled the AC again, waste my 4-5 hours but didn't get any solution and they did it 3 times in a month every week. You can hear the crackling(tak) sound in attached video at 0.06 & 0.16 sec, and after 1 hour of continuous running this sound repeats in every 6 seconds interval which is so irritating and annoying. So in short I'll say please don't waste your money on this product, you can get a great product from other brands in this amount. I paid 36000 in April-2024 for 2023 model without wifi. This is the biggest mistake of my life.

Never buy any LG AC through Amazon. I bought 2 ACs. One AC Condenser is gone defective after just 14 months. It was mentioned that there is additional 4 years warranty on condenser on the Amazon website plus the LG website as well but now additional warranty is denied because it is not mentioned in the invoice.
